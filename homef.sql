It is rooted in solidarity and in the building and protection of human and collective dignity.</p><p>We believe that neoliberal agendas driven by globalization of exploitation of the weak, despoliation of ecosystems and lack of respect for Mother Earth thrive mostly because of the ascendancy of enforced creed of might is right. This ethic permits the powerful to pollute, grab resources and degrade/destroy the rest simply because they can do so. HOMEF recognizes that this reign of (t)error can best be tackled through a conscious examination of the circumstances by which the trend crept in and got entrenched. HOMEF&#39;s work track is continuous political education that examines the roots of exploitation of resources, labour, peoples, territories, nations and regions.  Through this HOMEF contributes to the building of movements for recovery of memory, dignity and harmonious living with full respect of natural cycles of Mother Earth.</p><p>Three key areas of focus are <strong>fossil politics</strong>, <strong>hunger politics</strong> and creating spaces for knowledge generation and sharing.</p><h4>Fossil Politics</h4><p>Although the massive dependence on fossil fuels has been seen as the major cause of global warming, wars and destruction, the world’s addiction to fossil fuels is yet to wane. The fossil fuels industry together with international finance institutions and the military complex continue to engineer the literal scrapping of the bottom of the barrel to squeeze out more fossil fuels completely ignoring the harm and the fact that they are non-renewable and will ultimately be abandoned or exhausted. The short-term logic that empowers this blind drive is one that worships profit and ignores the future of the planet and her children. HOMEF work on this track builds from the power of the communities who subsidise this perverse industry and who suffer gross despoliation. HOMEF believes that a transition from fossil fuels must be rapid and urgent and devoid of distractions by way of fuels and techno-fixes that either depend on the same infrastructure that has rigged in the crises or claim to provide solutions to the crises in order to sustain the current polluting logic.</p><h4>Hunger Politics</h4><p>This track asks the basic question: why are people hungry. It also looks at why obesity is increasingly becoming a problem in the world today. HOMEF works in the paradigm of food sovereignty, rejects modern agricultural biotechnology, including gene drive technologies and exposes the false premises of food aid and its exploitative and contaminating linkages.</p><h4>Sustainability Academy</h4><p>Our Sustainability Academies provide the fundamental vehicle for the propagation of the change HOMEF works to build. The academy provides spaces for knowledge creation and sharing. Through this we work to eliminate ignorance and build self-reliance and confidence in the wisdom that has preserved and improved our environment over the millennia. The academy is not a physical structure, but rather fluid spaces for participatory learning. Through the academy HOMEF connects peoples and shares knowledge and ideas of what has worked or is working or would work. The space is vital for analyses and sharing of why and how communities are trained to acquiesce to exploitation, oppression and humiliation. The academy also helps to expose tokenistic actions to dull resistance and breed debilitating dependence. The Sustainability Academy is also a space for contest of ideas. The Sustainability Academy provides the space for our work on Fossil Politics and Hunger Politics.</p><p>The Academy has regular sessions each year with the length of one week each. Each session has at least one instigator/lecturer who inspires and challenges the people at separate meetings within that period.

The event was funded by the European Union through a project managed by Coventry University in the UK, and by SSNC (Swedish Society for Nature Conservation) through a project managed by IFOAM. It gathered 28 participants, including scientists, farmers, national and international NGO representatives and other stakeholders from 9 countries (Benin, Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Gambia, Togo, Germany, Senegal and UK) eager to learn more about and discuss the topic.</p><p>Parti cipants of the workshop shared information about the status of development of organic agriculture in their countries, and about their main challenges to develop the sector. IFOAM was also represented at the workshop, by Joelle Katto-Andrighetto, Value Chain Manager, who provided information on Participatory Guarantee Systems (PGS) and their challenges and opportunities, as well as those of third party certification. Participants had extensive group work focused on the steps needed for the development and promotion of PGS in the West Africa region. Finally, participants worked on the detailed development of a regional curriculum for a university program on organic agriculture.</p><p>The workshop concluded a 3-year project centered on regional cooperation in higher education. It was amazing to see how the participants, representing the newly formed WANOART network, could communicate in both French and English (the region has both Francophone and Anglophone countries) to adva nce regional priorities. PGS also generated a lot of enthusiasm and ideas for future development of regional organic marketing to complement export activities and give consumers access to organic products within the region.</p><p>For more information, please contact: Dr Emile N.

The continent has been the poster child of hunger and malnutrition since the structural adjustment programme (SAP) policies decimated the agricultural sector from the early 1980s. This picture has remained persistent for a number of reasons. Some of these include the occasional food shortages experienced in parts of the continent as a result of weather events that impact the agricultural sector and the way these shortages are managed. <br> <br> Some of us believe that African agriculture has been quite resilient and can be improved upon without having to be pushed into the mould fabricated by the policies whose aims are to make the continent dependent on imports and on so-called food aid. <br> <br> In this article we are responding to views credited to the Director General of the Nigeria Biotechnology Development Agency (NABDA) as published in the Vanguard newspaper of 31 December 2012 in a report captioned “BT Technology Can Assist Nigeria’s Food Security – Solomon”. <br> <br> We can understand the struggle of the head of agency set up to develop modern biotechnology seeking to perform their duties, but this must be within the realm of global reality, facts and fears concerning the ideas and products being plied.<br> <br> Before we look at the contentious issues, it is important we state that the idea of setting up the Nigeria Biotechnology Development Agency was hasty as it was set up in a situation where Nigeria did not have and still does not have an adequate regulatory framework such as a Biosafety Law. Secondly, an agency for the development of biotechnology should only have been set up after the need for such an agency had been clearly and publicly seen to exist especially with regard to its contentious push into food and agriculture. We must see danger signals when Prof Solomon states, “My major concern is that we should not be over regulated”. Generally, commercial proponents of genetic engineering in agriculture abhor regulation, and it is surprising that the NABDA boss should toe this line. <br> <br> Another preliminary issue here is that food security can best be attained within the context of food sovereignty. Food security is mainly concerned with availability and accessibility of food, keeping down the numbers of the hungry. Food sovereignty on the other hand goes beyond this to demand that such foods must be wholesome, culturally appropriate and are produced on the principles of agro-ecology to ensure maintenance of environmental integrity. Clearly modern biotechnology is against the achievement of food sovereignty as its products go against the grain of local contexts/environments and do not respect local knowledge but rather are dictated by corporate interests and those of governments who are bent on promoting the corporate takeover of food production and marketing systems around the world.<br> <br> The NABDA boss informs us that Nigeria already has three genetically engineered crops in confined field trial. He names them as BT cowpea in Zaria, the African bio-fortified sorghum also in Zaria and the Cassava plus at the National Root Crops Institute at Umudike, Abia State. It will be proper for the agency to publish the results of their confined field trials as well as notify Nigerians as to where the crops were engineered and for what purposes. Could it be that our agencies and institutes are merely surrogates for experimentation on behalf of foreign/commercial interests? Have these test crops already been smuggled into the farms? Are we eating them already?<br> <br> We have had cause to argue that Nigeria does not need genetically engineered cassava, for instance, when research institutes have already developed varieties that are capable of fighting the major diseases that plague the crop. The Umudike trials were for cassava fortified with higher levels of vitamin A. We certainly do not need to endanger our environment and crop varieties for such purposes when simple education to ensure that citizens eat crops such as carrots with high vitamin A content would suffice.<br> <br> One understands the frustrations of the promoters of genetically engineered crops. To start with the technology is fast becoming old fashioned as more aggressive varieties of ways to tamper with nature are being developed. We refer here to the vastly unregulated fields of nanotechnology and synthetic biology. In the light of recent developments, the NABDA boss’s claim in the interview that this is the era of biotechnology is far fetched. <br> <br> Our experts on genetic engineering keep parroting sales information from the likes of Monsanto whom the NABDA boss characterises as “the leader” in the field while speaking about the spread of Bt cotton. According to him, Monsanto is “the one giving the technology to Burkina Faso.” The last cotton harvest in Burkina Faso was a fiasco for the poor farmers who have been trapped in the Bt cotton web. <br> <br> Burkina Faso Bt cotton farmers harvested cotton with shorter fibres than the traditional varieties they used to plant and thus suffered loses. Why are our genetic engineering promoters not sharing this sad information with the public? In the past, the false example of Bt cotton success in Africa used to be the Makathini Flats in South Africa. The remarkable failures there and the abandonment of the crop have led to silence on that.<br> <br> Professor Solomon singles out Friends of the Earth as opposing the development of biotech in Europe. The truth is that there are many groups, including farmers and social movements, who are absolutely opposed to modern biotechnology in agriculture not only in Europe but also around the world. If the Europeans solved their food problems as alleged was this done via the genetic engineering route? <br> <br> Another claim that requires a quick response is where the report claims that “the Germans have suddenly developed the industrial potatoes and already, the Irish that we named the Irish potatoes after have taken the German potatoes and are already growing it. So, it now pleases them to do that. In Spain they are already growing BT rice and many part of Europe BT crops are already being developed.”<br> <br> The truth is that although there was an industrial starch GM potato developed in Germany, and approved at EU level nobody has grown it because a conventional variety already existed. In fact Europeans generally do not want to grow a GM crop even for industrial use.<br> <br> Unlike the impression the report seeks to give, there is only one very small trial for GM blight resistant potatoes in Ireland and even this little trial is widely opposed. And we should state here that although Spain does grow Bt maize it does not grow GM rice. In fact there is no commercial GM rice openly grown anywhere in the world. There was a global uproar in 2006/2007 when a GM variety labelled Liberty Link Rice was found on market shelves (through monitoring and testing) in some countries including in Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone and elsewhere in 2006 and 2007. With little or no monitoring of our markets there is likelihood that we may be assailed by these illegal products already.<br> <br> Genetically engineered crops are being resisted and rejected in many countries in Africa and it is not correct to paint a picture of major strides being made in East Africa. There are no such wide open doors.<br> <br> It is vital to mention here that a report of the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD) issued in April 2008 clearly showed that modern biotechnology is not the key to the future of food production in the world. Bodies such as the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), the World Bank, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) sponsored the report that was prepared by up to 400 scientists and related experts. About 60 countries including Nigeria have endorsed this report.<br> <br> The so-called Open Forum being run by NABDA once a month in various parts of the country to press for the signing of the Biosafety Bill by the president are anything but open. Nigerians deserve to have truly open debates on these very important issues so that citizens can weigh the options and decide if they want their genetic resources contaminated, eroded and taken over by corporate interests without regard to our sovereignty and right to wholesome food. Genetic engineering poses serious and unpredictable risks in the environment. The crops do not yield more than traditional varieties; they are not more nutritious and require extensive chemical external inputs made and sold by the same promoting corporations. African researchers should be concerned with methods of agro-ecological agriculture, cooperating with nature and using knowledge accumulated over centuries of practice.</p>','','article',1360917273,1360917273),(6,'Why Shell Must Be Held Accountable for its Niger Delta Ecocide','<p>Four Nigerian farmers and fishermen who are victims of multinational oil giant Shell’s unrelenting polluting activities in the Niger Delta are striving for justice.<br> <br> They have high hopes that on 30 January 2013 a Dutch court will issue a verdict in their favour as part of a ground-breaking legal case they filed against the Anglo-Dutch oil corporation.<br> <br> When, on 11 October 2012, the court in The Hague heard their case against Shell, it was the first time in history that a company was brought before a Dutch court to account for environmental damage caused overseas.<br> <br> Royal Dutch Shell’s pollution in Nigeria is caused by its subsidiary known as Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) in Nigeria.<br> <br> The company has faced several court cases in Nigeria and in the USA on charges of environmental and human rights abuse.<br> <br> Having Shell in the dock at The Hague sends a number of signals. For one, the days of ‘business as usual’ for multinational corporations may be drawing to a close.<br> Secondly communities may expect some respite if the company assumes more responsible working practices.<br> <br> If the company has a change of attitude, oil workers would have easier community access and probably enjoy better protection from the same pollution that damages these communities.<br> <br> At present many local workers are as impacted by the pollution as the poor communities.<br> <br> <br> <br> Impunity<br> <br> After decades of ruinous extraction of crude oil and gas in Nigeria, the October 2012 date was a landmark by itself as it signalled that the days of unbridled impunity may be drawing to a close.<br> <br> The case was brought to the court through the instrumentality of Milieudefensie (Friends of the Earth Netherlands) working closely with the Environmental Rights Action (Friends of the Earth Nigeria).<br> <br> The case commenced in 2008 with four victims from the villages of Goi, Ikot Ada Udo and Oruma in the Niger Delta as plaintiffs. Their complaints are emblematic of the horrendous environmental degradation that the oil industry has visited on the Niger Delta.<br> When it is said that the region is probably the most polluted place on earth the blame must be placed on the doorsteps of the oil companies operating there.<br> <br> And we should state here that as the clear sector leader in Nigeria, Shell’s behaviour leads the way for others.<br> <br> In the case before the Dutch court, the plaintiffs are demanding that Shell cleans up oil pollution in their communities, compensates those affected and ensures that new leaks do not occur from its pipelines.<br> <br> These have been the cardinal demands of the communities of the Niger Delta because they depend primarily on the environment for their livelihood endeavours including farming and fishing.<br> <br> The streams and creeks they depend on for portable water are serially hit by oil spills while forests have been set ablaze in inept efforts to clean up environmental damage or to cover up evidence of such spills.<br> <br> One other serious problem in the oil fields of Nigeria is the matter of illegal oil bunkering through which an indeterminate quantity of crude oil is stolen daily. <br> <br> Oil companies like Shell point accusing fingers at local communities, saying their interference with pipelines in an attempt to steal crude oil has resulted in the environmental problems we see today. However, the amount of crude stolen yearly is so huge that only theft on a massive scale can account for that.<br> In June 2012, the Financial Times quoted the Nigerian Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala as saying that 400,000 barrels of crude oil are stolen every day.<br> <br> Illegal bunkering persists because the oil companies refuse to install metres at well heads and flow stations that would allow Nigeria to know exactly how much oil is extracted on a daily basis and by extension how much oil is lost. Illegal bunkering is a massive international enterprise of horrendous proportions.<br> <br> <br> <br> Ogoniland<br> <br> One of the communities, Goi in Ogoni, has been completely ruined by oil spills and fires. It may well be a record that a community has been rendered desolate with no one living there anymore due to the activities of a giant fossil fuel company.<br> <br> A visit today to Goi presents evidence of ecocide or unusual crimes against Mother Earth that cannot be denied. Burnt fishponds, burnt mangroves, collapsed buildings and an oiled water body welcomes all.<br> <br> Sadly, some kids and old women still use this polluted water for food processing – despite the perpetual film of crude oil on it.<br> <br> When asked why they still dare to step into the murky waters their stock response is that they simply have no choice.<br> <br> The issue of choice is important here. In August 2011, the United Nations Environment Programme issued a damning report on the assessment of the environment of Ogoniland.<br> <br> One of the things the report revealed was that all the water bodies in Ogoniland are polluted with high levels of hydrocarbons.<br> <br> It also revealed that at some places the soil is polluted to a depth of five metres.<br> <br> The most troubling aspect is their assessment that it would require about 30 years of work to clean up the Ogoni environment. In an area where life expectancy is barely above forty it is clear that most people will never see a clean environment in their lifetime.<br> The Ogoni people expelled Shell from Ogoniland in 1993 because of the company’s lack of respect for the people and their environment.<br> <br> Despite the fact that Shell has not been operating the oil wells in Ogoniland since then, oil spills have not ceased in the territory, due to the presence of high-pressure pipelines conveying crude oil across the area to an export terminal (at Bonny).<br> <br> The destruction of the environment of Ogoniland and the other communities of the Niger Delta offers a classic context in which so-called Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is seen clearly as oxymoronic.<br> <br> Companies such as Shell engage in construction of health clinics as CSR projects. However, in a situation of unabating pollution through oil spills and gas flaring it is akin to pumping poison into one’s veins while occasionally dropping an aspirin down the throat as an antidote.<br> Moreover, by peculiar arrangements, CSR projects in the oil communities of Nigeria are accounted for as part of production cost of crude oil and are thus not actually funded from the massive profits of the companies. They constitute nothing more than smokescreens.</p>','','article',1360917459,1360917459),(7,'Dutch Court Ruling Against Shell - A Watershed','<p>January 30, 2013<br> Dutch Court Ruling Against Shell a Watershed, says ERA<br> <br> The ruling by a Dutch court today (January 30, 2013) holding Shell<br> responsible for the pollution of farmlands at Ikot Ada Udo, Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria, is a very important victory indeed. We are however disappointed that the court ruled otherwise with regard to the Goi and Oruma.

Shell has consistently denied responsibility. It refused to clean-up the spill and did not pay<br> compensation.<br> <br> Now Shell cannot maintain its ostrich stance with regard to the massive degradation of Ikot Ada Udo community.<br> <br> The case, which has Milieudefensie as co-Plaintiff, was filed in 2008 and had passed through lots of legal hurdles ostensibly set up by Shell before getting to this point of judgment. While Royal Dutch Shell Plc had maintained that it could not be held responsible for the actions of its subsidiary in Nigeria, the subsidiary Shell Petroleum Development Company Nigeria Ltd had insisted that it cannot be tried by the court in the Hague for problems arising from Nigeria. <br> <br> The Dutch judiciary in 2009 declared itself competent to try the case. Last October, the Dutch court had a full trial of the case whereupon the judgment of today declaring that Shell broke the law by not repairing leaks that destroyed the lands of the four farmers is based on.<br> <br> “Finding Shell guilty of the spill at Ikot Ada Udo is commendable but and we want to see how Shell has can celebrate the faulty conclusion reached by the court that they can be exonerated from the ecocide at Goi and Oruma. Their disdain for the wellbeing of communities that suffer the impacts of its reckless exploitation of oil in the Niger Delta has been legendary. The spill at Ikot Ada Udo lasted for months and in open farmland and yet Shell had the temerity to fight to avoid culpability. It is just and fair that it is held accountable for this crime,” said ERA/FoEN Executive Director, Nnimmo Bassey.<br> <br> “This win for the farmers of Ikot Ada Udo has set a precedent as it will be an important step that multinationals can more easily be made answerable for the damage they do in developing countries. We anticipate other communities will now demand that Shell pay for the assault on their environment”.<br> <br> Until now it&#39;s been very problematic to bring cases against these companies in their home countries, because the difficulties in application of their national legislation to incidents occuring beyond their shores.<br> <br> ERA/FoEN Director, Programmes and Administration, Godwin Uyi Ojo added that “While we commend the Dutch court ruling, it is now time the western countries pass laws compelling companies to enforce the same environmental responsibility standards abroad as at home.<br> <br> “Shell’s arguments in the face of incontrovertible evidence has again shown the double standards of the oil companies in treating spills incidents in Nigeria differently from their pollution in Europe or North America.

When the UNEP report was released there was a general sense of relief that at last a definitive scientific study has been carried out in at least a part of the Niger Delta and that remediation steps would be taken to rescue the people from the impacts of the pollution.<br> <br> Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC or Shell), the major polluter in the territory, paid for the study in a rather poetic turn of events, on the polluter-pays basis. If that was not an admission of culpability in the ecocide in Ogoniland, you may have to invent another word for the crime.<br> <br> The report showed a staggering level of pollution that would require 25-30 years of clean-up activities if there were to be a chance of real remediation. Many people expected the government to declare Ogoniland a disaster zone. The Ogoni people waited to see some clean-up action. The Nigerian people waited to see some clean-up action. The international community waited to see some clean-up action. That the expected action was not forthcoming was a scandal of massive proportions.<br> <br> Nothing was done until twelve full months rolled by. In other words, since the report was issued till that date, a full year was added to the estimated time needed to restore the Ogoni environment. But what was done after one year? <br> <br> It took one year after it had been ascertained that there was no safe drinking water in Ogoniland and that the land itself was polluted to depths of up to five metres in places, for any whisper to be heard from the corridors of power.<br> <br> The UNEP report set out simple emergency actions to be taken to ensure an acceptable clean up of Ogoniland. One of the key recommendations was that government should set up an “Ogoniland Environmental Restoration Authority.” This authority was to have a starting fund of US$1 billion. Rather than set up this body that would set about the restoration of Ogoni land, what government did was to set up what it calls the Hydrocarbon Pollution Restoration Project (HYPREP). This project has succeeded in planting some pollution warning signposts in Ogoniland and billboards on oil thefts in Port Harcourt.<br> <br> A cursory comparison of the recommended body and the entity that government created shows that something is critically wrong. Why set up a body that would restore rather than clean up pollution? Ogoniland is badly polluted as it is, to set up a body to compound the pollution is alarming, not amusing. Ken Saro-Wiwa, a stickler for correct concepts and sentences, would have written copiously on this twisted contraption if the jackboots had not wickedly truncated his life in 1995.<br> <br> UNEP officials led by Erik Solheim, former Norwegian Minister of Environment and International Development and UNEP Special Envoy for Disasters and Conflicts, visited Nigeria early February 2013 to meet with government officials and some partners in Abuja and Port Harcourt. The purpose of the visit was to get a sense of what was being done with the UNEP Environmental Assessment of Ogoniland and to know what the next steps would be.<br> <br> It is not clear what the team came away with, but we at least know that UNEP is committed to seeing the report implemented and Ogoniland cleaned. <br> <br> In a statement issued by UNEP at the start of the visit, Solheim who led the team said “With regard to Ogoniland, the UN system is committed to supporting the government throughout the entire process of implementing the recommendations of the report. On behalf of UNEP, I look forward to coordinated and collaborative action with our Nigerian and international partners in addressing pollution in Ogoniland.” <br> <br> The Ogoni people are one of the most mobilised peoples anywhere in the world. The umbrella Movement for the Survival of Ogoni (MOSOP) enjoys a high level of support across the Ogoni kingdoms, has provided consistent leadership over the years and is well respected by the people. That is, despite some difficult moments, as would be expected of any serious movement.<br> <br> The degree of cohesion of the Ogoni people provides an excellent template for government to set about the clean up of the territory in a transparent and easy manner. If there are to be difficulties it should be of the technical kind, not the socio-political varieties.<br> <br> It is not too late for the government to scrap HYPREP and set up the recommended “Ogoniland Environmental Restoration Authority.” We will call this the Authority for short.</p><div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2nTceTKr_6U/URlsjjKN-yI/AAAAAAAAAH4/UBiLk2CQb_8/s1600/IMG_5505.JPG\"><img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2nTceTKr_6U/URlsjjKN-yI/AAAAAAAAAH4/UBiLk2CQb_8/s320/IMG_5505.JPG\"></a></div><p><br> <br> <br> HYPREP was a hasty creation to tell the world that at least one step had been taken, one year after the release of the UNEP report.<br> <br> Government should not be shy to do the right thing. Steps taken in the wrong direction may be many, but keeping in that direction may not eventually lead to the right destination. It is equally wasteful to insist on building on a faulty foundation.<br> <br> Scrap HYPREP, set up the Authority. This Authority would then set about consulting the people, call mass meetings of the Ogoni people, circulate the popular (pidgin English) version of the summary of the UNEP report which can be downloaded from the UNEP website, present the strategy for the clean up to the people and transparently set out the budget outlay for the exercise. The Authority would have the Ogoni people endorse its broad plan and strategies for implementation and monitoring as well. The Authority should be domiciled in either the Ministry of Environment or in the Presidency. It should by no means be located in the Ministry of Petroleum Resources - a key polluter, through the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, in Ogoniland.<br> <br> The extent of pollution and the need to ensure that the clean up is not an occasion for jobbers must be stressed. As UNEP acknowledges, the clean-up required will be complex and there may not be a single method of getting this done. Any delay means further reducing the quality of life and the life expectancy of the people that has already dropped to just over 40 years mainly due to the hydrocarbon pollution. Bloodshed and great sacrifices have been borne by the Ogoni people. The clean up of the territory is not an occasion for gambling. <br> <br> The selection of consultants, contractors and the handling of the budget require very strict oversight. While we agree that it is possible to have officials in the Authority to handle the procurement and budgetary matters, it is believed that while the in-house crew play roles in those tasks, an agency such as UNEP should play major oversight roles. If this recommendation were accepted UNEP would not handle any of the clean up jobs, but would play a monitoring role. <br> <br> We are yet to see the Senate and the House of Representatives taking up the clean up of Ogoniland as a critical issue of concern. They need to. It is their duty to ensure that a proper Authority is set up and that there is adequate budgetary outlay for the tasks with both government and Shell putting the money on the table and having an umpire like the UNEP empowered to warehouse the funds. <br> <br> Getting things on the right track is extremely urgent. As UNEP stated, “Continued delay in the implementation of the recommendations will not only undermine the livelihoods of the Ogoni communities, but will also cause the pollution footprint to expand. In the long run, the findings of the study itself will become dated, and therefore further assessments will be needed, causing additional delays.” UNEP hoped to “convey this sense of urgency to the stakeholders during” the mission. It would be another scandal if this sense of urgency gets ignored.</p>','','article',1360918177,1361127306),(10,'The GMO push in Africa is a Trojan horse for political control: Joe Mzinga','','','article',1361426739,1361427478),(11,'The People\'s Agreement of Cochabamba','<p>World People’s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth<br><br>April 22nd, Cochabamba, Bolivia</p><p><strong>PEOPLE’S AGREEMENT</strong></p><p>Today, our Mother Earth is wounded and the future of humanity is in danger.<br><br>If global warming increases by more than 2 degrees Celsius, a situation that the “Copenhagen Accord” could lead to, there is a 50% probability that the damages caused to our Mother Earth will be completely irreversible. Between 20% and 30% of species would be in danger of disappearing. Large extensions of forest would be affected, droughts and floods would affect different regions of the planet, deserts would expand, and the melting of the polar ice caps and the glaciers in the Andes and Himalayas would worsen. Many island states would disappear, and Africa would suffer an increase in temperature of more than 3 degrees Celsius. Likewise, the production of food would diminish in the world, causing catastrophic impact on the survival of inhabitants from vast regions in the planet, and the number of people in the world suffering from hunger would increase dramatically, a figure that already exceeds 1.02 billion people.The corporations and governments of the so-called “developed” countries, in complicity with a segment of the scientific community, have led us to discuss climate change as a problem limited to the rise in temperature without questioning the cause, which is the capitalist system.<br><br>We confront the terminal crisis of a civilizing model that is patriarchal and based on the submission and destruction of human beings and nature that accelerated since the industrial revolution.<br><br>The capitalist system has imposed on us a logic of competition, progress and limitless growth. This regime of production and consumption seeks profit without limits, separating human beings from nature and imposing a logic of domination upon nature, transforming everything into commodities: water, earth, the human genome, ancestral cultures, biodiversity, justice, ethics, the rights of peoples, and life itself.<br><br>Under capitalism, Mother Earth is converted into a source of raw materials, and human beings into consumers and a means of production, into people that are seen as valuable only for what they own, and not for what they are.<br><br>Capitalism requires a powerful military industry for its processes of accumulation and imposition of control over territories and natural resources, suppressing the resistance of the peoples. It is an imperialist system of colonization of the planet.<br><br>Humanity confronts a great dilemma: to continue on the path of capitalism, depredation, and death, or to choose the path of harmony with nature and respect for life.<br><br>It is imperative that we forge a new system that restores harmony with nature and among human beings. And in order for there to be balance with nature, there must first be equity among human beings.   We propose to the peoples of the world the recovery, revalorization, and strengthening of the knowledge, wisdom, and ancestral practices of Indigenous Peoples, which are affirmed in the thought and practices of “Living Well,” recognizing Mother Earth as a living being with which we have an indivisible, interdependent, complementary and spiritual relationship.   To face climate change, we must recognize Mother Earth as the source of life and forge a new system based on the principles of:<br><br>harmony and balance among all and with all things;<br>complementarity, solidarity, and equality;<br>collective well-being and the satisfaction of the basic necessities of all;<br>people in harmony with nature;<br>recognition of human beings for what they are, not what they own;<br>elimination of all forms of colonialism, imperialism and interventionism;<br>peace among the peoples and with Mother Earth;<br>The model we support is not a model of limitless and destructive development. All countries need to produce the goods and services necessary to satisfy the fundamental needs of their populations, but by no means can they continue to follow the path of development that has led the richest countries to have an ecological footprint five times bigger than what the planet is able to support. Currently, the regenerative capacity of the planet has been already exceeded by more than 30 percent. If this pace of over-exploitation of our Mother Earth continues, we will need two planets by the year 2030.   In an interdependent system in which human beings are only one component, it is not possible to recognize rights only to the human part without provoking an imbalance in the system as a whole. To guarantee human rights and to restore harmony with nature, it is necessary to effectively recognize and apply the rights of Mother Earth.   For this purpose, we propose the attached project for the Universal Declaration on the Rights of Mother Earth, in which it’s recorded that:<br><br>The right to live and to exist;<br>The right to be respected;<br>The right to regenerate its bio-capacity and to continue it’s vital cycles and processes free of human alteration;<br>The right to maintain their identity and integrity as differentiated beings, self-regulated and interrelated;<br>The right to water as the source of life;<br>The right to clean air;<br>The right to comprehensive health;<br>The right to be free of contamination and pollution, free of toxic and radioactive waste;<br>The right to be free of alterations or modifications of it’s genetic structure in a manner that threatens it’s integrity or vital and healthy functioning;<br>The right to prompt and full restoration for violations to the rights acknowledged in this Declaration caused by human activities.<br>The “shared vision” seeks to stabilize the concentrations of greenhouse gases to make effective the Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which states that “the stabilization of greenhouse gases concentrations in the atmosphere to a level that prevents dangerous anthropogenic inferences for the climate system.” Our vision is based on the principle of historical common but differentiated responsibilities, to demand the developed countries to commit with quantifiable goals of emission reduction that will allow to return the concentrations of greenhouse gases to 300 ppm, therefore the increase in the average world temperature to a maximum of one degree Celsius.<br><br>Emphasizing the need for urgent action to achieve this vision, and with the support of peoples, movements and countries, developed countries should commit to ambitious targets for reducing emissions that permit the achievement of short-term objectives, while maintaining our vision in favor of balance in the Earth’s climate system, in agreement with the ultimate objective of the Convention.<br><br>The “shared vision for long-term cooperative action” in climate change negotiations should not be reduced to defining the limit on temperature increases and the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, but must also incorporate in a balanced and integral manner measures regarding capacity building, production and consumption patterns, and other essential factors such as the acknowledging of the Rights of Mother Earth to establish harmony with nature.<br><br>Developed countries, as the main cause of climate change, in assuming their historical responsibility, must recognize and honor their climate debt in all of its dimensions as the basis for a just, effective, and scientific solution to climate change. In this context, we demand that developed countries:<br><br>•          Restore to developing countries the atmospheric space that is occupied by their greenhouse gas emissions. This implies the decolonization of the atmosphere through the reduction and absorption of their emissions;<br><br>•          Assume the costs and technology transfer needs of developing countries arising from the loss of development opportunities due to living in a restricted atmospheric space;<br><br>•          Assume responsibility for the hundreds of millions of people that will be forced to migrate due to the climate change caused by these countries, and eliminate their restrictive immigration policies, offering migrants a decent life with full human rights guarantees in their countries;<br><br>•          Assume adaptation debt related to the impacts of climate change on developing countries by providing the means to prevent, minimize, and deal with damages arising from their excessive emissions;<br><br>•          Honor these debts as part of a broader debt to Mother Earth by adopting and implementing the United Nations Universal Declaration on the Rights of Mother Earth.<br><br>The focus must not be only on financial compensation, but also on restorative justice, understood as the restitution of integrity to our Mother Earth and all its beings.<br><br>We deplore attempts by countries to annul the Kyoto Protocol, which is the sole legally binding instrument specific to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by developed countries.<br><br>We inform the world that, despite their obligation to reduce emissions, developed countries have increased their emissions by 11.2% in the period from 1990 to 2007.<br><br>During that same period, due to unbridled consumption, the United States of America has increased its greenhouse gas emissions by 16.8%, reaching an average of 20 to 23 tons of CO2 per-person. This represents 9 times more than that of the average inhabitant of the “Third World,” and 20 times more than that of the average inhabitant of Sub-Saharan Africa.<br><br>We categorically reject the illegitimate “Copenhagen Accord” that allows developed countries to offer insufficient reductions in greenhouse gases based in voluntary and individual commitments, violating the environmental integrity of Mother Earth and leading us toward an increase in global temperatures of around 4°C.<br><br>The next Conference on Climate Change to be held at the end of 2010 in Mexico should approve an amendment to the Kyoto Protocol for the second commitment period from 2013 to 2017 under which developed countries must agree to significant domestic emissions reductions of at least 50% based on 1990 levels, excluding carbon markets or other offset mechanisms that mask the failure of actual reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.<br><br>We require first of all the establishment of a goal for the group of developed countries to achieve the assignment of individual commitments for each developed country under the framework of complementary efforts among each one, maintaining in this way Kyoto Protocol as the route to emissions reductions.<br><br>The United States, as the only Annex 1 country on Earth that did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol, has a significant responsibility toward all peoples of the world to ratify this document and commit itself to respecting and complying with emissions reduction targets on a scale appropriate to the total size of its economy.<br><br>We the peoples have the equal right to be protected from the adverse effects of climate change and reject the notion of adaptation to climate change as understood as a resignation to impacts provoked by the historical emissions of developed countries, which themselves must adapt their modes of life and consumption in the face of this global emergency. We see it as imperative to confront the adverse effects of climate change, and consider adaptation to be a process rather than an imposition, as well as a tool that can serve to help offset those effects, demonstrating that it is possible to achieve harmony with nature under a different model for living.<br><br>It is necessary to construct an Adaptation Fund exclusively for addressing climate change as part of a financial mechanism that is managed in a sovereign, transparent, and equitable manner for all States. This Fund should assess the impacts and costs of climate change in developing countries and needs deriving from these impacts, and monitor support on the part of developed countries. It should also include a mechanism for compensation for current and future damages, loss of opportunities due to extreme and gradual climactic events, and additional costs that could present themselves if our planet surpasses ecological thresholds, such as those impacts that present obstacles to “Living Well.”<br><br>The “Copenhagen Accord” imposed on developing countries by a few States, beyond simply offering insufficient resources, attempts as well to divide and create confrontation between peoples and to extort developing countries by placing conditions on access to adaptation and mitigation resources. We also assert as unacceptable the attempt in processes of international negotiation to classify developing countries for their vulnerability to climate change, generating disputes, inequalities and segregation among them.<br><br>The immense challenge humanity faces of stopping global warming and cooling the planet can only be achieved through a profound shift in agricultural practices toward the sustainable model of production used by indigenous and rural farming peoples, as well as other ancestral models and practices that contribute to solving the problem of agriculture and food sovereignty. This is understood as the right of peoples to control their own seeds, lands, water, and food production, thereby guaranteeing, through forms of production that are in harmony with Mother Earth and appropriate to local cultural contexts, access to sufficient, varied and nutritious foods in complementarity with Mother Earth and deepening the autonomous  (participatory, communal and shared) production of every nation and people.<br><br>Climate change is now producing profound impacts on agriculture and the ways of life of indigenous peoples and farmers throughout the world, and these impacts will worsen in the future.<br><br>Agribusiness, through its social, economic, and cultural model of global capitalist production and its logic of producing food for the market and not to fulfill the right to proper nutrition, is one of the principal causes of climate change. Its technological, commercial, and political approach only serves to deepen the climate change crisis and increase hunger in the world. For this reason, we reject Free Trade Agreements and Association Agreements and all forms of the application of Intellectual Property Rights to life, current technological packages (agrochemicals, genetic modification) and those that offer false solutions (biofuels, geo-engineering, nanotechnology, etc.) that only exacerbate the current crisis.<br><br>We similarly denounce the way in which the capitalist model imposes mega-infrastructure projects and invades territories with extractive projects, water privatization, and militarized territories, expelling indigenous peoples from their lands, inhibiting food sovereignty and deepening socio-environmental crisis.<br><br>We demand recognition of the right of all peoples, living beings, and Mother Earth to have access to water, and we support the proposal of the Government of Bolivia to recognize water as a Fundamental Human Right.<br><br>The definition of forests used in the negotiations of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which includes plantations, is unacceptable. Monoculture plantations are not forests. Therefore, we require a definition for negotiation purposes that recognizes the native forests, jungles and the diverse ecosystems on Earth.<br><br>The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples must be fully recognized, implemented and integrated in climate change negotiations. The best strategy and action to avoid deforestation and degradation and protect native forests and jungles is to recognize and guarantee collective rights to lands and territories, especially considering that most of the forests are located within the territories of indigenous peoples and nations and other traditional communities.<br><br>We condemn market mechanisms such as REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) and its versions + and + +, which are violating the sovereignty of peoples and their right to prior free and informed consent as well as the sovereignty of national States, the customs of Peoples, and the Rights of Nature.<br><br>Polluting countries have an obligation to carry out direct transfers of the economic and technological resources needed to pay for the restoration and maintenance of forests in favor of the peoples and indigenous ancestral organic structures. Compensation must be direct and in addition to the sources of funding promised by developed countries outside of the carbon market, and never serve as carbon offsets. We demand that countries stop actions on local forests based on market mechanisms and propose non-existent and conditional results. We call on governments to create a global program to restore native forests and jungles, managed and administered by the peoples, implementing forest seeds, fruit trees, and native flora. Governments should eliminate forest concessions and support the conservation of petroleum deposits in the ground and urgently stop the exploitation of hydrocarbons in forestlands.<br><br>We call upon States to recognize, respect and guarantee the effective implementation of international human rights standards and the rights of indigenous peoples, including the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples under ILO Convention 169, among other relevant instruments in the negotiations, policies and measures used to meet the challenges posed by climate change. In particular, we call upon States to give legal recognition to claims over territories, lands and natural resources to enable and strengthen our traditional ways of life and contribute effectively to solving climate change.<br><br>We demand the full and effective implementation of the right to consultation, participation and prior, free and informed consent of indigenous peoples in all negotiation processes, and in the design and implementation of measures related to climate change.<br><br>Environmental degradation and climate change are currently reaching critical levels, and one of the main consequences of this is domestic and international migration. According to projections, there were already about 25 million climate migrants by 1995. Current estimates are around 50 million, and projections suggest that between 200 million and 1 billion people will become displaced by situations resulting from climate change by the year 2050.<br><br>Developed countries should assume responsibility for climate migrants, welcoming them into their territories and recognizing their fundamental rights through the signing of international conventions that provide for the definition of climate migrant and require all States to abide by abide by determinations.<br><br>Establish an International Tribunal of Conscience to denounce, make visible, document, judge and punish violations of the rights of migrants, refugees and displaced persons within countries of origin, transit and destination, clearly identifying the responsibilities of States, companies and other agents.<br><br>Current funding directed toward developing countries for climate change and the proposal of the Copenhagen Accord are insignificant. In addition to Official Development Assistance and public sources, developed countries must commit to a new annual funding of at least 6% of GDP to tackle climate change in developing countries. This is viable considering that a similar amount is spent on national defense, and that 5 times more have been put forth to rescue failing banks and speculators, which raises serious questions about global priorities and political will. This funding should be direct and free of conditions, and should not interfere with the national sovereignty or self-determination of the most affected communities and groups.<br><br>In view of the inefficiency of the current mechanism, a new funding mechanism should be established at the 2010 Climate Change Conference in Mexico, functioning under the authority of the Conference of the Parties (COP) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and held accountable to it, with significant representation of developing countries, to ensure compliance with the funding commitments of Annex 1 countries.<br><br>It has been stated that developed countries significantly increased their emissions in the period from 1990 to 2007, despite having stated that the reduction would be substantially supported by market mechanisms.<br><br>The carbon market has become a lucrative business, commodifying our Mother Earth. It is therefore not an alternative for tackle climate change, as it loots and ravages the land, water, and even life itself.<br><br>The recent financial crisis has demonstrated that the market is incapable of regulating the financial system, which is fragile and uncertain due to speculation and the emergence of intermediary brokers. Therefore, it would be totally irresponsible to leave in their hands the care and protection of human existence and of our Mother Earth.<br><br>We consider inadmissible that current negotiations propose the creation of new mechanisms that extend and promote the carbon market, for existing mechanisms have not resolved the problem of climate change nor led to real and direct actions to reduce greenhouse gases.   It is necessary to demand fulfillment of the commitments assumed by developed countries under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change regarding development and technology transfer, and to reject the “technology showcase” proposed by developed countries that only markets technology. It is essential to establish guidelines in order to create a multilateral and multidisciplinary mechanism for participatory control, management, and evaluation of the exchange of technologies. These technologies must be useful, clean and socially sound. Likewise, it is fundamental to establish a fund for the financing and inventory of technologies that are appropriate and free of intellectual property rights. Patents, in particular, should move from the hands of private monopolies to the public domain in order to promote accessibility and low costs.<br><br>Knowledge is universal, and should for no reason be the object of private property or private use, nor should its application in the form of technology. Developed countries have a responsibility to share their technology with developing countries, to build research centers in developing countries for the creation of technologies and innovations, and defend and promote their development and application for “living well.” The world must recover and re-learn ancestral principles and approaches from native peoples to stop the destruction of the planet, as well as promote ancestral practices, knowledge and spirituality to recuperate the capacity for “living well” in harmony with Mother Earth.<br><br>Considering the lack of political will on the part of developed countries to effectively comply with commitments and obligations assumed under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol, and given the lack of a legal international organism to guard against and sanction climate and environmental crimes that violate the Rights of Mother Earth and humanity, we demand the creation of an International Climate and Environmental Justice Tribunal that has the legal capacity to prevent, judge and penalize States, industries and people that by commission or omission contaminate and provoke climate change.<br><br>Supporting States that present claims at the International Climate and Environmental Justice Tribunal against developed countries that fail to comply with commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol including commitments to reduce greenhouse gases.<br><br>We urge peoples to propose and promote deep reform within the United Nations, so that all member States comply with the decisions of the International Climate and Environmental Justice Tribunal.<br><br>The future of humanity is in danger, and we cannot allow a group of leaders from developed countries to decide for all countries as they tried unsuccessfully to do at the Conference of the Parties in Copenhagen. This decision concerns us all. Thus, it is essential to carry out a global referendum or popular consultation on climate change in which all are consulted regarding the following issues; the level of emission reductions on the part of developed countries and transnational corporations, financing to be offered by developed countries, the creation of an International Climate Justice Tribunal, the need for a Universal Declaration of the Rights of Mother Earth, and the need to change the current capitalist system. The process of a global referendum or popular consultation will depend on process of preparation that ensures the successful development of the same.<br><br>In order to coordinate our international action and implement the results of this “Accord of the Peoples,” we call for the building of a Global People’s Movement for Mother Earth, which should be based on the principles of complementarity and respect for the diversity of origin and visions among its members, constituting a broad and democratic space for coordination and joint worldwide actions.<br><br>To this end, we adopt the attached global plan of action so that in Mexico, the developed countries listed in Annex 1 respect the existing legal framework and reduce their greenhouse gases emissions by 50%, and that the different proposals contained in this Agreement are adopted.<br><br>Finally, we agree to undertake a Second World People’s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth in 2011 as part of this process of building the Global People’s Movement for Mother Earth and reacting to the outcomes of the Climate Change Conference to be held at the end of this year in Cancun, Mexico.</p>','','article',1361428619,1361428662),(12,'Climate Change and the Looming Food Crisis','<p>Inaugural HOMEF Sustainability Academy 19-23 August 2013</p><p><strong>Climate Change and the Looming Food Crisis</strong></p><h4>Sustainability Academy: Mobilisation through Knowledge</h4><p>HOMEF is proud to announce its inaugural Sustainability Academy also known as HOME School.

However, Mariam Mayet, director of the ACB points out: &#34;The ISAAA in its desperate attempt to bolster the popularity of GM crops in the media, has overestimated the spread of GM crops in SA by a staggering 400%! According to the latest figures from the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF), the combined maize and soybean cultivation in South Africa increased by less than 150,000 ha over the stated period and the area planted with GM cotton has declined by 3,000 ha.&#34; <br> <br> In fact South Africa has witnessed an increase in non-GM maize cultivation. Between the 2010/11 and 2011/12 growing seasons, the area of non GM maize cultivation increased by 38% (or 210,000 ha). &#34;It is likely that the issue of insect pests developing resistance to the toxins produced by GM maize is a major factor behind this shift away from GM maize in South Africa.&#34; Said Mayet.<br> <br> The ISAAA further claims that developing countries planted 52% more GM crops than industrial countries and small farmers were the main beneficiaries. However, this includes the extensive mono-crops planted in Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina and Uruguay. &#34;GM production particularly in Latin America occurs on vast industrial estates. The industry has always promised that GM crops would help small farmers, but the soya barons in Brazil and Argentina are not our idea of &#39;small&#39;&#34; said Gareth Jones from the ACB.<br> <br> The reality is that 2012 was truly the biotech industry&#39;s &#39;annus horribilis.&#39; The ISAAA is ominously silent on the need for long-term feeding studies identified by the international scientific community following the damning results of the Seralini GM rat study; the 24 million ha of US farmland over-run with glyphosate resistant weeds; or the new GM crops in the pipeline, engineered to be resistant to even more toxic herbicides such as 2,4-D, Dicamba and glufosinate, to deal with this catastrophe.<br> <br> &#34;The $45 million the biotech industry spent to fight against GM food labelling in California illustrates the double standards by which it operates. While claiming to be eradicating hunger and achieving environmental sustainability for the public good, the biotech industry has denied the same public any rights to free choice when it comes to the food they eat or the systems of agriculture they want.&#34; Said Jones.<br> <br> The ACB wants answers from the GM industry on the following:<br> <br> If GM crops are so good for small farmers, why did the Indian state of Maharashtra ban GM cottonseed sales in 2012 – does it have anything to do with the near 40% crop failure fuelling a wave of suicides?<br> If GM crops are so badly wanted by African countries, why did Kenya ban imports at the end of last year? <br> Why is there so much controversy about exactly how much GM is being grown in Egypt and Burkina Faso? Even the ISAAA admits Egypt grew less GM last year, and Burkina is reported to have banned Bt cotton altogether pursuant to farmers abandoning GM cotton in that country; and If GM crops are the answer to our global food crisis, why did BASF pull out of Europe altogether last year? <br><br> Contact:    <br> Gareth Jones +27 81 493 4323<br> Mariam Mayet +27 83 269 4309</p>','The Africa Centre for Biosafety (ACB) has dismissed the findings of the biotechnology industry\'s flagship annual report, published by the GM industry funded \'NGO\', the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA), as mischievous and erroneous.\r\n','press_release',1361789785,1361789785),(29,'GMO Factsheets','<p>GMO (Genetically Modified Organisms) have been a subject of intense debate in the last decade.

ERA is also the host of Oilwatch International – the global South’s resistance network to reckless exploitation of fossil fuels.</p><p>ERA began life as a project of the Civil Liberties Organisation (CLO) around 1990. It began its early years while I was a member of its Board (1993-1999). It became an independent organisation when it became impossible for it to operate in the world of environmental networks while being anchored in the human rights community. The environment out of which it was born gave ERA the unique platform and character that forcefully pushed the fact that environmental rights are even more holistic than human rights because humans are merely a part of the environment and even though their rights are considered predominant this does not mean that theirs are necessarily superior to other beings or to nature herself.</p><p>For twenty years, ERA has been powered by key principles among which are the following:</p><ul><li>That every African has a right to a safe and satisfactory environment favourable to his/her development as captured in Article 24 of the African Charter of Peoples and Human Rights.</li><li>That human rights are also well defended when ecosystems are respected.</li><li>That the promotion of environmentally responsible governmental, commercial, community and individual practices is best attained through the empowerment of local people.</li><li>That local people have the right and knowledge to control local resources</li><li>Pro-environment policy changes are best worked for though non-violent resistance.</li></ul><p>We stayed on course over the years and especially during the difficult days when Nigeria was under military dictatorship because we had dedicated ERA people and because we had an unambiguous philosophical compass that ensured we did not drift. Today I look back with satisfaction that ERA people, whether in or outside ERA, have stayed the course.</p><p>Over these years, we have suffered persecution, faced afflictions and enjoyed triumphs. Our triumph has been that our work with communities impacted by deforestation, land grabs, oil spills, gas flares and pollutions of all types has succeeded because the people have resolutely stood against the pushers of these harmful practices.</p><p>We have stayed the course because we view every scene of environmental harm inflicted by the agency of man as a crime scene. Although we sometimes resort to civil actions as a measure of resistance we note that these are not sufficient to stem environmental crimes. To stop those who reap profits from environmental damage laws governing those activities ought to be urgently upgraded to make it possible for criminal charges with long jail terms to be pressed against individual criminals and those who hide behind corporate shields. Ecocide would be an appropriate umbrella law to confront the massive lawlessness that run rampant across Nigeria and many nations of the world today.</p><p>Today I look back across twenty short years of momentous changes. I am happy that the four persons (Oronto Douglas, Nick Ashton Jones, Godwin Ojo and I) who brought this group to be are still engaged in the defence of Mother Earth in one way or the way. I remember our days of challenging harmful big dams in Northern Nigeria, massive logging in forests in many of our Southern States. I remember our struggles against oil spills and gas flares. I remember our battles against wholesale destruction of communities by government to pave the way for corporate claws to sink deeper into our lands.</p><p>We have fought steadily against the wasting of our environment and livelihoods by the petroleum sector. The world’s addiction to carbon-high life has elevated dirty oil companies to the level of the gods. Easy oil has now given way to tough oil. The scraping of the bottom of the barrel has thrown up dangerous extractive methods and spewing ever more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and sentencing the world to climate catastrophe. And while global leaders would not commit to provide funds for adaptation and resilience building, multiples of what is needed is being expended on wars fought for profit at the expense disposable lives – sometimes in the name of exporting democracy. In the era of peak oil it appears we have passed over peak democracy without attaining democracy in the first place.</p><p>Today I call upon all of us to tell the emperor that he is naked, to tell the promoters of neoliberalism that they are running (at one spot) on empty tanks! Let us shout it out loud: it is time to leave the oil in the soil; from Yasuni to Ogoni, to Kaiso in the Rift Valley to Lofoten in Norway. And if Nigeria is serious about fighting global warming gas flaring must be stopped immediately. Shutting down oil production in order to tackle the gas flaring problem makes economic sense if we consider the implications of catastrophic global warming. And of course the government must halt oil theft, halt the regime of unaccounted for oil through lack of metering. Do I need to add that delays in cleaning up Ogoni land and other polluted parts of Nigeria is an unacceptable disregard for the right to life and to a safe environment of the peoples.</p><p>Today, while celebrating our 20 years of marching on for environmental rights, I remember individuals and communities who have greatly inspired me as a person. Ken Saro-Wiwa, executed by the State on false charges on 10 November 1995. I remember the peoples of Umeuchem, Bakalori, Odi, Odioma, Ilaje, Gbaramatu and others. I salute the mentoring I continue to receive from our foremost community activist, Comrade Che Ibegwura who, at over 80 years, keeps trudging on the path of environmental justice. I salute Sister Majella Macarron, a Catholic nun from Ireland whose gift of books in those early days helped to frame our work. I salute my colleagues in ERA. I salute my wife and family for unstinting support over the years. I salute all our comrades across Africa and across the continents of the world. Your presence here today is of great significance to me and to us.</p><p>As we look back, we also look forward. Twenty years have passed. Twenty more will come. And much more still. The road is long and the runners will be many. The baton must be passed on. And so, while remaining in the trench with the foot soldiers, it gives me great pleasure to hand that baton to my brother and comrade, Godwin Ojo. And I thank you for marking this day with us.</p>','','article',1364911601,1364911601),(40,'BRICS To Sustain The Oil-Based System','<p>Durban, 25th of March 2013</p><p>BRICS TO SUSTAIN THE OIL-BASED SYSTEM</p><p>Oilwatch International notes that the economic and political formation known by the acronym BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) started as an idea of Goldman Sachs for describing the main emerging markets. It is easy to read as a grouping conceptualized not in the interests of the people or the earth but for the sake of capital accumulation for the 1% and dispossession of the 99%, sustained by a system for the continuing extraction and consumption of fossil fuels.</p><p>The world has thus been saddled with yet another arbitrary and artificial multi-lateral collective like the G8, the G20 and whatever other “G” may be dreamt up tomorrow. Generally, such groupings have the role of subverting formal multilateral processes where some possibilities still exist for democratic decision-making. Groupings like the BRICS are like old-boy clubs, bestowing a sense of exclusivity on their members and enticing them to work for the collective interest of the powerful and to the detriment of others. When BRICS collectively gave $75 billion to the IMF in 2012, it was not Europe or the US which lost voting power – but Africa. When BRICS (minus Russia) signed the ‘Copenhagen Accord’ with Washington in 2009, this sleazy deal confirmed that the fossil-fuel addicted economies could continue polluting unabated while the rest of Africa is cooked by climate change.</p><p>The governments of the BRICS pretend that they are standing up against neo-colonial and imperial forces. They also suggest that their countries&#39; corporations compare favourably to the global North’s. These claims have little foundation in reality. The BRICS&#39; infamous power, oil and other fossil-fuel companies (whether private or state-owned) engage with impunity in the same misbehaviour that foreign transnational companies in the same fields do. They aid repression, drive environmental destruction and harm local livelihoods.</p><p>Brazil’s Petrobras, Russia&#39;s Gazprom and Lukoil, India&#39;s CoalIndia Ltd., China&#39;s CNPC and Sinopec, and South Africa’s Sasol, among others, are all extending their reach deep into their continents and beyond, taking advantage of each country&#39;s role as regional hegemon.</p><p>Given the definition of the BRICS as a grouping of “markets” rather than societies, it is not surprising the way they are reduced to their products. As Russian analyst Anna Ochkina writes for the Durban “brics-from-below” coalitions: “Brazil is essential for agricultural supplies, China provides cheap labour, India supplies cheap intellectual work force for high tech industries, South Africa provides minerals and Russia supplies minerals, oil and gas. The scale and conditions of provision of these resources for global capital makes BRICS countries essential for the current system” [1].</p><p>While the BRICS present themselves as offering benevolence to the territories they plan to economically carve, their own peoples have to endure serious socio-economic, political and civil rights violations. They live with serious inequality, lack of adequate infrastructure, increased levels of violence and other symptoms of development oriented not toward people but rather toward government and corporate profit [2].</p><p>Oilwatch views groupings of this ilk as attempting to partition the world into various markets and spheres of influence, and to support each other as they meddle in the affairs of nations they work to exploit and oppress. Blocs like the BRICS are wedges for breaking apart other, more democratic spaces, eroding solidarity and promoting narrow market interests.</p><p>This week&#39;s BRICS summit in South Africa will be a key battleground for both emerging and already imperial forces. As the biggest economy on the African continent, South Africa found that it could not stand by and watch while what was the BRIC began a second scramble for Africa, without trying to grab a slice of the pie for itself. And so South Africa forced itself into contention and the BRIC acquired an “S”.</p><p>Africa’s minerals and other resources have been objects of desire for plunderers and adventurers of every ilk over the centuries. Of late, land grabs have supplemented the grabbing of other African resources. Through these grabs, BRICS and similar blocs seek to entrench failed neoliberal agendas as well as an already obsolete fossil fuel- and dirty energy-driven civilization. The BRICS do not seem to realize that the destination of their planned drive on wheels of markets driven by dirty investments and the grabbing of resources is a brick wall. Or dead troops in search of their leaders’ mineral interests (as in unfortunate South Africans in the Central African Republic just as BRICS begins its Durban summit).</p><p>The grouping of nations into blocs by commodities and financial traders such as Goldman Sachs must rank as one of the most blatant subversions of the collective rights of peoples today. The situation will only be exacerbated by Goldman Sachs’ likely influence over the BRICS Bank proposed at a recent March meeting in South Africa. One leading Johannesburg official at Goldman Sachs is the former governor of the South African Reserve Bank, and Pretoria has requested that SA be the host for the new BRICS Bank – which Beijing reportedly supports.</p><p>Such a BRICS Bank could only exacerbate the social, economic and environmental chaos already caused in part by multilateral financing. Existing development finance institutions in BRICS countries – like South Africa’s Development Bank of Southern Africa or BNDES, the Brazilian development bank – offer sobering lessons. The spectacular failures of Goldman Sachs, as well as those of other Wall Street companies holding huge stocks of physical commodities such as oil storage tanks, metal warehouses and power plants [3], should send strong signals that their dreams and desires must be repudiated and rejected.</p><p>Oilwatch International denounces the contraption called BRICS and all other groupings set up to drive divisive and exploitative agendas around the world. We believe the time has come for the peoples of the countries in groups such as the BRICS, G8, and G20 to demand that their elected leaders shun those harmful blocs that destroy formal multilateral spaces and plunge the world into violence and deeper crises as evidenced by spiralling climate change, financial, economic and food crises.</p><p>OILWATCH INTERNATIONAL<br> www.oilwatch.org<br> <br> <br> NOTES:<br> [1] ccs.ukzn.ac.za<br> [2] Friends of the Earth South Africa. 20 March 2013.

In addition, the laws set out for Israel in the Old Testament were applicable to Israelites, foreigners and strangers. In other words, everyone within the jurisdiction of Israel was covered by the duty of care demanded by the laws and regulations. <br> <br> The Bible demands the protection of the poor and the weak. Mistreating the poor is seen as an affront to God. Falsehood is denounced by the Bible and false climate &#34;solutions&#34; must fall under this category of evil. False climate &#34;solutions&#34; can be seen as the reprehensible use of false scales which the Bible describes as abominable and disgusting.<br> <br> Micah 6:10-12 (NLT)<br> What shall I say about the homes of the wicked filled with treasures gained by cheating?<br> What about the disgusting practice of measuring out grain with dishonest measures?<br> 11 How can I tolerate your merchants who use dishonest scales and weights? 12 The rich among you have become wealthy through extortion and violence. Your citizens are so used to lying that their tongues can no longer tell the truth.<br> <br> <br> Humanity&#39;s destructive bent is clearly demonstrated in the many senseless wars nations generate and promote. The damage done by modern warfare unveils the savagery of modern man. Warfare by remote control, and through the use of drones, make wars appear like playing mere video games. Bursts of explosions mean nothing to those who merely sit in comfortable locations to push buttons. Lives are decimated and the environment gets thrashed.<br> <br> The Scriptures demand that humankind exercise care for the environment even in times of war. Consider this Bible passage:<br> <br> Deuteronomy 20:19 (NLT)<br> When you are attacking a town and the war drags on, you must not cut down the trees with your axes. You may eat the fruit, but do not cut down the trees. Are the trees your enemies, that you should attack them?<br> <br> In Genesis 1:27 When man was created, God made both male and female underscoring the fact that we are made to have relationships. That connection goes beyond peoples to include the entire creation.<br> <br> We are enjoined to love God and to love our neighbours. Our neighbours include everyone and indeed all creation. The Bible says that all creation cries for redemption and yet rather than allow nature to enjoy some respite we thrash everything around us as if there would be no tomorrow.<br> <br> Humans were placed in the Garden and given the task to care for and to tend it. To be a stewards. <br> <br> The command to have dominion over nature often cited from Genesis 1:28 if properly understood does not urge destructive extractivism. The Bible does not give to humans a dominion to destroy. It was one of care. In fact the word is translated as &#34;govern&#34; in one translation of the Bible.<br> <br> We remind ourselves that we are made in the image of God. The Bible at several places describes God as a shepherd. Jesus Christ himself declared that he came to serve and not to be served (Philippians). If we are made in the image of God it is fair to expect that we would live and care for nature, for God&#39;s creation.<br> <br> The Interdependence of species in nature is so clear to see. This can be tracked to the fact that we were made from the earth. Is it not awesome that we breathe in what trees breathe out? The burning of fossil fuels puts too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As a mark of respect for Mother Earth and in humanity&#39;s interest it is time to leave fossil fuels in the soil and immediately halt opening of new oil and gas wells. Fracking, tar sands and shale gas extraction must be halted. And we must be honest to accept that there is nothing like &#34;clean coal.&#34;<br> <br> God created the universe bit by bit. He paused after each act to review what had just been made or done. Indeed, each step was followed by a review. Before God rested he made a final evaluation and declared that all was very good. If we should stop to evaluate how we have related with Mother Earth, what would be the verdict? Would we say that everything is very good? How would we judge the huge amounts of climate changing carbon being emitted daily into the atmosphere? Would we applaud the many resource wars ongoing at various scales in parts of the world today? Would we be proud to present the false solutions driven by the urge to profit from disaster under the cover of geopolitical relations governed by &#34;might is right&#34;?<br> <br> The truth is that humankind has been a poor steward over the planet. We have made the earth ugly and inhospitable. <br> <br> Our penchant for falsehood allows us to pass off climate conflicts as religious wars. It is time to allow Mother Earth have a sabbath rest. It is time for the children of the planet to rise up in dignity and solidarity and refuse to allow men use religious cover to pitch otherwise peaceful neighbours against each other. People of faith have a duty to speak truth to power.

So the “gap” is 13 GT of CO2e.</p><p>If this “gap” is not closed by 2020 the global average temperature of the planet will increase in more than 4 to 8ºC. The last time the Earth lived a global warming like this was millions of years ago.</p><p>In the UNFCCC every delegation knows the urgency of the climate crisis… but the speeches and arguments are almost the same.</p><div id=\"attachment_10979\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-10979\" title=\"UNFCCC_466_Bonn\" src=\"http://www.rtcc.org/files/2013/05/UNFCCC_466_Bonn.jpg\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Representatives from the 195 parties to the UNFCCC are meeting in Bonn to discuss ideas for a global emissions treaty 2015 (Pic: UN)</p></div><p>The US and others that have quit from the Kyoto Protocol want a “pledge and review regime”. In other words: no targets. No binding commitments. Lets do what each one can do… and lets see. And what is the US willing to do? 3% emissions cut based on 1990 levels by 2020.</p><p>This is almost nothing. And what is even worse is that more and more countries are entering into that same dynamic with the argument that even if their countries cut their emissions by half the impact in the global emissions will be less than 1% because the bigger emitters are not taking the lead.</p><p>The discussions instead of focusing on how to reduce global emissions to much more less than 44 GT CO2e by 2020 has been about the principles of the Convention, “equity”, “historical responsibility” and “CBDR” (Common But Differentiated Responsibility) between developed and developing countries.</p><p>The climate emergency that we are living was not the first priority.</p><p><strong>Common sense</strong></p><p>First, define the target: global emissions of much more less than 44 GT of CO2e by 2020.</p><p>Second, divide that amount between the world population in 2020 (around 7.6 billion). That is 5.7 tons of CO2e per capita by 2020.</p><p>Third, apply the principles of the convention (historical responsibility, CBDR and equity) to that per capita number. This will give different targets of per capita emissions for each country.</p><p>Those who carry more historical responsibility will have to do more and those with less historical responsibility will have more space for development, but all together will guarantee that the world is below 44 GT of CO2e by 2020.</p><p>There should not be a pledge and review system for anybody. No one is exempt. Everybody has to adopt binding commitments. Some do much more, some do less, some can increase emission for some years but its clear when they will reduce and by how much.</p><p>And in order to guarantee these binding commitments we need to strengthen the compliance system with some kind of climate justice tribunal and sanctions.</p><p>Here the <a href=\"http://www.rtcc.org/the-rtcc-climate-change-a-z/\">Common But Differentiated Responsibility</a> (CBDR) principle should also be applied. Strong sanctions for historical emitters, moderate sanctions for others and very light sanctions for the least responsible.</p><p>In other words the principles of the convention have to be preserved but not understood as if only one side has binding commitments and the other side can do what they want. At this stage of the climate crisis we all have to commit with figures on the table to be below the 44 GT of CO2e by 2020.</p><p><strong>Carbon ‘omissions’</strong></p><p>Another important issue is the outsourcing of emissions of developed countries.</p><p>One third of China’s emissions are consumed in the “developed” world. To be fair and equitable the per capita emissions should take into account the consumption and not only production of green house gas emissions, because many developed countries can simply outsource their emissions.</p><p>In the same line a country should not pass its binding commitment to another country through offsets and carbon market mechanisms. The obligation of that country is the obligation of that country.</p><p>Finally the issue of the “right to development” should be not understood as the “right to pollute” as much as the others. In Bonn we have heard from many developing countries that they need development to reduce poverty.</p><p>This formula is not totally true. In the majority of countries, poverty is the result of concentration of wealth in very few hands. The main task to address poverty is not development but redistribution of wealth at national, regional and global level.</p><p>The “right to development” is the right to attend to the fundamental needs of the population following a very different kind of development than the current capitalist way that doesn’t take into account the limits of the Earth.</p><p><em>Pablo Solon is Executive Director of Focus on the Global South, and a former ambassador of the Plurinational State of Bolivia to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/unitednations\" title=\"More from guardian.co.uk on United Nations\">United Nations</a>.</em></p>','The United Nations climate negotiations in Bonn are more of the same and we are running out of time.\r\nEverybody recognizes that there is a “gap”, but there are no concrete proposals to solve the “gap”.

You may think you have seen it all- especially if you have seen or lived in the horrors of oil activities in the Niger Delta. I thought so too, particularly because I have devoted at least two decades of my life in persistent pursuit of polluted lands (at home and abroad) searching for ways to comprehend the great harm generated by extractive activities. <br> <br> Some of the places that have left deep impressions in my heart are documented in my book Oilwatching in South America – Or, Guana Guara - Mudfish Out of Water a Pollution Tour Of Venezuela, Curaçao, Peru &amp; Ecuador. This book is more or less the diary of a pollution tour of these countries carried out in 1997 under the auspices of Oilwatch International. Others can be found in To Cook a Continent – Destructive Extraction and Climate Impacts on Africa. <br> <br> After many years of following the heavy pollution of communities in South West Durban in South Africa, and with kin ears for developments related to proposed fracking in the Karoo, I was still not prepared for the level of impacts from mining in Witbank, Old Coronation mine and other Highveld communities. This filed trip was organised by groundWork (Friends of the Earth South Africa) as a prelude to Oilwatch Africa conference that was held in Midrand mid May 2013. On the group were activists from eleven African countries.<br> <br> The field trip in Mpumalanga Province where mines literally turned to walking in minefields! No, we did not rush to the mines. Our first port of call was the offices of the South African Green Revolutionary Council (SAGRC) at Witbank. It was early in the morning, but the comrades were already waiting to receive us. Led by Matthews Hlabane, we were quickly given a short introduction to the Witbank.<br> <br> Mining started here in 1896 and with it began a reign of land grabbing and pollutions. From the 1950s the environmental problems began to intensify and were glaring and undeniable. Acid mine drainage polluted the water and coal dusts took over the air. With these contaminants it was not a surprise that the locals began to suffer from headaches, dizziness, kidney failures and other diseases.<br> <br> We were informed that there are eight (8) coal-fired plants in Witbank and up to seven hundred (700) mines from where coal and platinum are dug. But that is not all there is a pile of five thousand (5000) applications for mining permits, with many of them “linked to the ruling party,” we were told. Overall, there are 6000 abandoned mines in the country and among these are the abandoned coalmines of the Highveld. <br> <br> He regretted that there were no direct gains to the community even though so much “wealth” was being excavated from beneath their feet. The coal extracted here is used for electricity generation and for export. The level of contamination here is so high that an estimated 30 billion Rand will be needed for environmental rehabilitation.<br> <br> Although we were told of sinkholes, unstable grounds and impacts on entire biodiversity<br> <br> Our visit took us to the abandoned Transvaal and Delagoa Bay Mine (TMDB). On arrival we were greeted by a mountain range of wastes and polluted water seeping from the tremendous pile. Walking in this field requires extreme caution. We had to go in a single file, trusting that our guide knew what spot to tread and which could be considered as safe ground. We were bemused and some thought it was preposterous for anyone to insist that we couldn’t walk where we pleased. Soon enough we all saw why rebellion was not a good option here. There were cracks in the ground best picked out by trained eyes.<br> <br> We soon knew we were on the devil’s territory when we began to smell sulphur. And then we saw heat waves simmering from holes ahead of us. The smell got stronger as we moved nearer. We were walking over caves of fire. A once luscious land was now 880 hectares of hell!<br> <br> We were told of, and shown sinkholes scattered in the fields. Anyplace could crack up and anytime and a yelp may be the only goodbye to be heard before the victims disappear into netherworld. These mines are located between two Townships and kids and others traverse these burning mines daily either to school or to work. Some kids are said to have fallen into these sinkholes. And someone hazarded that criminals may also have used these burning pits as convenient places to bury their crimes.<br> <br> Spontaneous fires started in the mines in the 1930s and they were eventually closed in the 1950s. Interesting. It is said that the fires in the mines were burning both the roof supporting pillars and the roofs themselves. We guess that before the mines were closed, perhaps while one portion of the mine was burning, miners were pressed to keep digging at other parts. That can be understood in an apartheid context. But why are the flames not extinguished and the land remediated today?<br> <br> Our friends told us that because of lack of adequate public response to their complaints about the air quality and other pollutants, they have had to train themselves on how to do that for themselves. In fact, we were told that of occasions when officials bring testing equipment and the community folks were the ones who showed the officials how the equipment were operated. Talk of community empowerment! Tests show that some of the water bodies here are either very acidic or highly alkaline. <br> <br> Leaving the field of horror, we passed by the VANCHEM Ltd factory. Our comrades asked us to look up at the sky. Thick smoke bellowed from the stacks. That was not surprising. But they asked us to note that no birds were flying in the area. Well, that was true. “They simply die if they try,” we were told. Okay. Get me out of here!<br> <br> We were told that to keep healthy, workers in this factory are compelled to drink milk everyday. I could not laugh. I have personally heard at an environmental health workers workshop of oil company workers (machine operators) in Nigeria who are urged to drink milk as a way of keeping their bodies purified of pollutants. This myth has also been heard of in India. Workers are kept in the dark hopes that milk eliminates the impacts of pollution. See my 2010 article tiled The ‘Milking’ of Oil Workers for more about this and the cynical actions of corporations. <br> <br> Our next port of call was the Old Coronation Township sitting on Old Coronation coalmines. The ground here is very unstable. We were taken to a huge pit into which a preschool disappeared after the ground gave way in 2012. Sinkholes started happening here more than five decades ago. <br> <br> Many resident of this Township ‘mine’ coal in huge waste heaps in the neighbourhood. Stories abound of kids and women who met their death here when the pile of waste collapsed on them as they dug for the carbon needed for cooking and for heating their shacks.<br> <br> It was one story of woe after another. We saw women and kids digging for occasional lump of coal. We heard of resource and job opportunities conflicts with migrant workers from the SADC region. We saw extensive acid/water ponds. Devoid of life as expected. <br> <br> “The graves in Highveld are full,” one comrade tells us. “if you live here and drink the water, there is a 70 per cent chance you will end up with liver problems.” Sadly, kids sometimes swim in the warm ponds and there is a chance that they gulp in the lethal water. There is a high incidence of sinuses, asthma, tuberculosis and others. “<br> <br> “The doctors work with the mines and the mines work with the government. The people are left to fall through the cracks. The Highveld is a compost,” another comrade insists without elaborating. <br> <br> We were thoroughly depressed at this point. Getting to watch a youth drama perform was hopefully going to be a relief. Soon we were gathered in a community hall built and donated by a mining company! Speeches and tales of woes from various cities, townships and communities over, the Mpumalanga Youth Against Climate Change drama group took centre stage.<br> <br> The acting was excellent and the storyline and message was clear and direct. Global warming was better termed “global burning” and humans were shown as anointed to be the most foolish specie on earth. The youngsters declared, “our governments have failed us, but we will not fail ourselves.”<br> <br> As we left these heavily polluted communities, Comrade Matthew declared that the Witbank is the most polluted city in the world. A Nigerian comrade retorted that the Niger Delta was the most polluted region on earth. An argument ensued but was happily settled that one was a city and the other a region. But best of all, we ought to be arguing about which is the cleanest and safest, not which is most based by capital.

I know you’ve been involved with Environmental Rights Action for over two decades in Nigeria, and that you trained as an architect, so what got you involved, what made you shift from architecture to devoting your life to protecting the environment?</strong></p><p>Bassey: Well, I still do some architecture. [laughs]</p><p><strong>Activism doesn’t pay the bills? Shocking.</strong></p><p>No, it doesn’t pay the bills!</p><p>As I grew up, I saw only a very few years of democracy. From 1966 we had military rule in Nigeria, and thereafter on and off for thirty years the country was under the control of the military.</p><p>In the late eighties there was a strong campaign against the military, a campaign for democracy in Nigeria. I was in the mainstream human rights movement, campaigning mostly against the military, and also against bad prison conditions, police brutality, the repression of local communities.</p><p>Around 1990 the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MSOP) became quite strong, led by the late Ken Saro-Wiwa. This movement produced the Ogoni bill of rights, made very strong ecological, and also political, demands on the state, and asked for a clean up of the environment. Now, while this was going on, it occurred to me and some of my colleagues that many of the human rights issues we were campaigning on actually had their roots in environmental abuses.</p><p>We campaigned for better prison conditions, better police detention conditions, but we had to ask the question, why are people being detained in the first place? And what we discovered was that people were being criminalized because they demanded environmental justice, because they demanded economic benefits from resource extraction in their communities. People were being criminalized just because they asked for dialogue, with a corporation like Shell or with the government.</p><p>The Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF), which is my main focus now, is an ecological think tank whose major objective is to overturn the current thought pattern which makes people in Nigeria, in Africa especially, accept the neo-liberal logic as the only way to do things. This idea that only the private sector can do anything right. Well the people in the private sector are no different from the people in the public sector, and the private sector depends heavily on the public sector to be able to do things.</p><p>With this new organization we are focusing on two broad themes: fossil fuels, which includes alternative energy, climate change, and climate justice, and hunger politics.</p><p>We are looking at why people are hungry. If you’ve been paying attention to what the G8 are doing, they’re creating a new alliance for nutrition in Africa.</p><p>We see that as a way of opening up the continent to big seed companies like Monsanto, who will introduce GMO seeds in the name of nutrition. They’ve been engineering some crops which are very popular in Africa, primarily to increase the amount of Vitamin A.</p><p>If you need Vitamin A you can get it very easily, from foods and other things, there is no need to go to the extent of engineering crops just to enhance the level of vitamin A in them. Moreover, people don’t eat these crops in quantities that would provide a sufficient amount of Vitamin A, which is the excuse the companies are giving us about why these GMO crops are necessary.</p><p>So we ask, why are people hungry? Not just in Africa, but globally. I think this is a very pertinent question.</p><p>Along with these two broad themes we have what we call the Sustainability Academy, or HOME school.  It will have two sessions a year, and each session will have at least one facilitator, that we call an instigator, there to instigate positive change.</p><p>So we will get someone with a strong point of view, who is knowledgeable about a particular topic, and get them to speak on that topic to policy makers, to undergraduates and scholars and to high school students and community members. All at different meetings, but the same topic, the same presentation, on different levels. We are trying to create a common understanding on certain issues as an organizing strategy.</p><p><strong>You said when you were younger you were working on human rights and then got drawn to the environment because you were looking for the root causes of these human rights abuses. Now, with the Health of Mother Earth Foundation, it sounds like a similar process of trying to look at the root causes of why we have these issues – why is there hunger? Why are there these environmental problems? Do you believe the current system can be reformed, or do you think we need to change the system in order to save the planet?</strong></p><p>Absolutely. We need to overturn the system. Most policy-makers believe in transactions. We don’t need transactions. What we need is transformation. We need radical change. The kind of change we need is not the one where you look and say, well, it’s slightly transformed from what it was.</p><p>We need total change, because if you look at the world today, the petroleum civilization, which has driven industrialisation over the past 200 years or so, is totally unsustainable. We know that the resource we are using is non-renewable.</p><p>We know it’s harming the planet. The World Bank – if you’re looking for a conservative organisation, there’s nothing more conservative than them – they said just before the last meeting in Doha that at least 80 per cent of known fossil fuel reserves must be left untouched if we’re going to avoid runway global warming.</p><p>If we’re going to have a reasonable chance of survival as a species. And yet the world knows that this is causing global warming, and they know that this resource is depleting, but they’re saying “wait! we can get more!”</p><p>We can get more from the Tar Sands, more from the deep sea, more from all kinds of things. But that is not the issue. The issue is not whether you can get more. The issue is the destruction of the planet.</p><p>They’re destroying life. So we need a situation where people can think more clearly than they do right now – not just about profit. We need to restructure the economic paradigm. We cannot allow the world to be run on speculation and financialization of everything. It’s serious work.</p><p><strong>But then the question becomes, how do we bring about that change?</strong></p><p>It’s going to be a political decision, and if you work in the environmental justice movement, you don’t just stand alone as an environmental activist. You have to work with social movements, work with political movements, work with labour, work with everybody, because the thing is…we simply have to be able to get into the driver’s seat of making decisions.</p><p>We need more people getting active in decision-making, understanding the issues and taking an active role. That is why in the HOME school thing, where I’m speaking with policy makers, for example, the first HOME school is going to be on climate change.</p><p>We’re having that in August. And the first session will be with legislators and Nigerian negotiators and Ministry of Environment people because they need to be reminded that the way the negotiations have been undertaken is not going to solve the problem.</p><p>It may bring some commerce or revenue from projects – maybe adaptation and mitigation measures and things like that, but that is just immediate and temporary. And so we want to get them to begin to look at the fundamental issues and see how narrow the negotiations have been, and to really understand why Copenhagen was such a disaster – Cancun, Durban, Doha – and how Poland will be a big disaster this year. We need to change the way decisions are being made.</p><p><strong>And I guess change the form of democracy too, because you’re quite a vocal critic of the democratically elected government in Nigeria as well, right?</strong></p><p>That’s a big issue really, because globally, if you look at the governments we have around the world, even the biggest or most applauded democratic settings, there’s very little democracy. Many of the governments are put there by big corporations who pay for their elections and who lobby them, and they have to do the bidding of those corporations.</p><p>They’re not really looking at what is in the best interest of the people, only what will support business. If you look at a place like Nigeria, you find government officials going on the economic road-show. They’re looking for direct foreign investment. This is also driving land-grabbing, but they don’t call it land-grabbing.</p><p>They say it’s foreign direct investment! They don’t care what happens in the future. So all this – there are no easy answers, but the whole so-called democratic setting needs to be critically reviewed. We need people to regain their sovereignty. We need to decide what we allow, and what we don’t allow – what people want, and what they don’t want.</p><p>People know what they want, but right now, we’re not able to enforce what we want and what we don’t want, so we need a situation where true democratic space is created in the world and there’s bottom-up leadership, not top-down leadership. The fact that we elect a man, or woman, does not mean we surrender our sovereignty to him or her.</p><div id=\"block-openx-6\"><p><strong>I was wondering if you could tell me more about what’s happening in Nigeria in terms of rebels standing up to the government or oil companies. We hear a lot about religious conflicts but not much about resistance to the oil companies…<br></strong></p><p>There’s always been conflict in the middle belt – the middle portion of Nigeria – and it’s usually characterised as a religious conflict. But I think it’s actually a climate conflict, because you have pastoralists who are displaced by desertification, who can’t raise their cattle where they used to live before.</p><p>They have to migrate southward, and then they meet farmers who need their land to cultivate crops, and then this creates conflict between the pastoralists and the farmers. It’s not because they are Muslims and Christians. It’s simply about climate. This is a climate conflict, but as long as it’s characterised as a religious conflict, then nobody is going to find a solution.</p><p><strong>So tell me about what brings you to Canada, and your thoughts on our role in fighting climate change.</strong></p><p>I’m very excited about coming here; the environmental policies in Canada are a big sore on the conscience of the world, a huge wound on the conscience of the world. The government insists on going down the wrong path, developing resources that destroy the environment and poison the water. Generally, they don’t care about the effects on human health, but just think about economic gains.</p><p>I’m here to show that this logic of expansion and economic growth at any cost which has taken root here is very dangerous. In Canada your government has said they will not make any serious commitments to fight global warming. They pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol, even while the Kyoto Protocol was on life support. In negotiations, Canada led the fight against binding commitments to emission reduction. I’m also here to express real solidarity with people who are impacted by these developments, and who are campaigning against this destructive path.</p><p>To stand together is the beauty of our campaigns; that we can lend support to each other, that we can stand together and also generate our own stories to let the whole world know the concerns of the people and that this degradation is going on.</p><p>Leading humanity to destruction doesn’t make sense, and it must not continue. It is also for governments and those pushing this agenda to know they are doing this against the wishes of the people, and what they are doing is wrong. No matter what profit they’re making or the economic gain, it doesn’t make sense at all if what you’re doing is breaking the cycles of nature. The way it’s going there is no good way to do it, this environment can never be restored. It will take thousands of years to get back to normal shape.</p><p>This is why every location where this destruction is going on, is a crime scene – simply put.</p><p><strong>As someone who has been a prominent environmental activist in Africa for many decades, you obviously know that in 2006 the Harper government was elected here in Canada. For us a great deal changed as a result of his election, is that a change that you noticed in Canada’s behaviour before and after Stephen Harper?</strong></p><p>Whatever happens in the rich countries is known across the world, and patterns of action and inaction are very well documented and well known. Sometimes we get surprised, other times we know this is what to expect. Yes, obviously we’ve seen the disturbing trend, but we are not surprised the government is going the way it is going.</p><p>We are never really shocked that there doesn’t seem to be a realization that we have only one planet. We have natural cycles we have to maintain, runaway global warming is not going to be good for anybody. No country is strong enough to withstand natural disasters; the worst is that these are no longer even natural disasters because these are man made.</p><p>We’re the ones breaking the cycle; we’re the ones changing the patterns of the weather. Again you know, this logic that whatever we need we can obtain from nature without any price is a logic that needs to be changed. I hear frequently “global warming is good, it will melt the Arctic ice and then we can reach the resources there.”</p><p>It’s just plain stupid, but this is what corporations are saying. We’re going to have shorter navigation, we can get to Russia from here without going around the world to get minerals and crude oil. Everyone is trying to see what continental shelf moves closer to the north pole, so they can plant their own flags there.</p><p>This is why we have to intensify the resistance and globalize the resistance, build linkages across the world on these issues so that when politicians and transnational corporations insist on going down the wrong path we can hold them accountable.  Ecocide must be recognized as a crime, and that recognition is being pushed through the United Nations right now.</p><p>But nations can begin, citizens can begin. There should be laws in each country that recognize ecocide for what it is; crimes against humanity, crimes against mother earth, crimes against the future, crimes against our children. Corporations should not be allowed to hide behind the inaction of governments and commit this ecocide. The directors of these companies should be held to account for the massive degradation that is going on.</p><p><strong>What would you like to see people here in Canada do in terms of concrete action to try and change things for the better?</strong></p><p>Look at what Idle No More did, just simple actions, but they captured everybody’s imagination. We need things likes this, we need more people to say no to the destruction. To me saying no is an alternative because if you say you don’t want something, that thing must stop, and that thing stopping is an option already. If all of us stop doing the wrong thing, we are going to find a thousand right ways to do things differently.</p><p>There are particularities in certain nations, and we will find out what is the best way to do certain things. But the things that are bad are universally bad. Destruction and dependence on fossil fuel is not good anywhere in the world.</p><p>Quebec now is moving more into exploiting fragile ecosystems and places that are restricted; more people should come out and say no we don’t want this anymore. We don’t want this traditional economic growth; we don’t want to live today and not tomorrow. We have to care about what’s going to happen to our children, the planet and us. Those who have investments in this sector should pull out those shares and divest.</p><p>We have to reduce consumption. We have to live within our means. Things can get exhausted, that’s what it means to live within ones means. Right now what we’re doing with this kind of environmental destruction is like saying well I don’t have money, but I’ll continue living on credit.</p><p>It’s not even as good as that because we know that this is bad. That is what’s happening the way nature is being degraded and destroyed. Of course ultimately, once every four years we should be careful who we vote in. We have to be careful about who we vote in and who should be trusted in these positions.</p></div>','When we speak of Nigeria, and of the Nigerian people’s inspired resistance to the devastation wrought by multinational oil companies such as Shell, the name of the late, and great, Ken Saro-Wiwa is inescapable.\r\nBut many others have continued to toil in the shadows over the years since Saro-Wiwa’s death.

INSTEAD WE BELIEVE IT IS ESSENTIAL TO ADVANCE AN APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE FOUNDED ON FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF CITIZENSHIP, POLITICAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS, DEMOCRATIC DECENTRALISATION, RULE OF LAW, ACCESS TO DUE JURIDICAL PROCESSES AND TRANSPARENT, DEMOCRATIC AND ACCOUNTABLE GOVERNANCE.</p><p>Recognising that globalised economic activity, growing demand for natural resources, and the continued absence of transparent, democratic and accountable governance have enabled unprecedented levels of resource capture across multiple scales, rendering environmental injustices ever more politically complex and ideologically sophisticated;</p><p>Acknowledging that these conflicts typically lead to calls for environmental justice on the part of the local people affected by the negative impacts of outside interest on their local resources;</p><p>Asserting that justice entails righting the wrongs committed (sometimes through compensation), restoring the environment, and promising to cease and desist harmful activity, as well as preventing further wrongs through strengthening participation in decision-making over the use of resources;</p><p>Recognising that calls for environmental justice relate to recognition of rights to customary resources, territories, and cultural difference, fair negotiation processes and fairness in the distribution of benefits and costs, both within society and inter-generationally;</p><p>Concerned by the fact that those seeking to secure resources and manage these burgeoning conflicts (e.g. governments and corporations) are increasingly turning to solutions based on compensation payments for disadvantaged communities for losses incurred by expropriation, resource use, pollution and environmental degradation [i];</p><p>Troubled by the fact that these initiatives are based on the premise that payments make the distribution of outcomes more equitable, and therefore presume that such measures produce just outcomes [ii];</p><p>We assert that global calls for environmental justice are multi-dimensional, concerned not solely with equity in the distribution of environmental risk and benefits, but equally with recognition of the diversity of people and cultures, and citizenship-based participation in political processes which create, manage and implement environmental policy [iii];</p><p>We argue that these plural, contextual notions of injustice are inevitably insufficiently dealt with by compensatory approaches (apart from a very narrow range of cases, for example, where historic liability and punitive damages are concerned). We identify the following reasons why compensatory approaches fall short of redressing injustices and serving justice:</p><ol><li>The focus on outcomes deflects attention from the root causes of injustices [iv]. Compensation is an ‘end-of-pipe’ intervention that may address distributive outcomes but not the underlying distribution of assets and political-economic power [v].</li><li>Compensation is founded on particular conceptions of distributive justice [vi]. Many people experience injustices in ways that cannot be redressed via compensation, or they demand other forms of redress than compensation [vii].</li><li>The focus on compensation may become coercive in contexts of stark economic inequality and political power asymmetries. Furthermore, compensation can reinforce inequalities among communities as well as engender new forms of conflict and corruption [viii].</li><li>Compensation only serves justice where affected people can enjoy democratic rights and have access to legal recourse [ix], yet even under these circumstances, experience has shown that powerful vested interests are able to evade payment of compensation through the use of lengthy and costly legal appeals, or that even when it is granted, compensation rarely reaches those entitled to it.</li></ol><p><strong>We therefore:</strong><br> Express our solidarity with global movements of environmental justice and the struggles of disadvantaged local communities to secure justice;</p><p>Assert that there is a need for strategies to bring about environmental justice that effectively address the distribution of assets and outcomes as well as issues of democratic participation, recognition and environmental integrity. Such strategies should be founded on principles of: citizenship, rights to customary resources, territories and cultural difference, democratic decentralisation of powers to local bodies, rule of law, access to due juridical processes and transparent governance [x];</p><p>Demand that governments hold perpetrators of environmental injustice culpable for their actions through local and global mechanisms of global governance, and act to prevent further future injustices;</p><p>Call upon companies, governments and multilateral organizations to acknowledge that some values (such as loss of identity and culture, sacredness) can never be compensated for, and cease the co-opting of injustices through compensatory measures that more often than not serve corporate interests over long term community needs;</p><p>Support the application of compensation or payments of ecological debt, within an integrated strategy for transformative / restorative reforms [xi].</p><p><strong>Signatories:</strong><br> Alejandro Argumedo, Associación ANDES, Peru<br> Nnimmo Bassey, Oilwatch International, Nigeria<br> Patrick Bond, University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa<br> Jessica Budds, University of East Anglia, UK<br> Vasudha Chhotray, University of East Anglia, UK<br> Hari Dhungana, Southasia Institute of Advanced Studies, Nepal<br> Asim El-Moghraby, Sudanese National Academy of Sciences, Sudan<br> Tom Greaves, University of East Anglia, UK<br> David Gritten, RECOFTC – The Centre for People and Forests, Thailand<br> Nicole Gross-Camp, University of East Anglia, UK<br> Jun He, Kunming Institute of Botany, China<br> Hali Healy, King’s College London, UK<br> Cam Hoang, Institute of Cultural Studies, Vietnam<br> Ruth Makoff, University of East Anglia, UK<br> Adrian Martin, University of East Anglia, UK<br> Shawn McGuire, University of East Anglia, UK<br> Patrik Oskarsson, University of Gothenburg, Sweden <br> Iokiñe Rodríguez, Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Científicas, Venezuela<br> Madhu Sarin, independent analyst, India<br> Heike Schroeder, University of East Anglia, UK<br> Thomas Sikor, University of East Anglia, UK<br> Oliver Springate-Baginski, University of East Anglia, UK<br> Leah Temper, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Spain</p><p>[i] Such compensation takes various forms, for instance as payments for exposure to pollution or dispossession from land and forests, funds provided to enhance adaptive capacity against large-scale stresses (e.g. climate change), and payments for environmental services (e.g. water and carbon) and benefit-sharing arrangements (e.g. in protected area management and the mining sector).</p><p>[ii] This also underpins mainstream thinking about the Green Economy. This asserts that economic growth and environmental sustainability can go hand in hand if rights to natural resources and clean environments are allocated to economic agents, who then interact in old and new markets to optimize environmental management and resource use, and compensate potential losers through payments.</p><p>[iii] Schlosberg 2004 Defining Environmental Justice (OUP: Oxford)</p><p>[iv] For example, strong local resistance to the eight-fold increase of Durban&#39;s port and petrochemical complex reflects not only municipal/national planning overriding community needs, but of a much deeper dependency on imported oil and a debilitating vulnerability to a volatile world economy. Local peoples’ dispossession from forests and protected areas across the Global South reflects the effects of colonialism and particular conceptions of people-nature relations, even if this may not be too apparent to people involved in place-based struggles.</p><p>[v] Even where the key injustice is one of inequitable distribution, compensation does not create a long-term solution. For example, the Indian government has long sought to placate local communities’ demands for access to land and forests by promising them a share in the benefits derived from participatory forest management. Yet, this did not redress the underlying injustice springing from historical local ownership rights to forest lands, which was only addressed when the 2006 Forest Rights Act recognised forest dwelling communities rights to customary resources and territories. Offering people a share in resource benefits on an ad hoc basis is different from redistributing assets and possibilities to them in order to create a secure basis for people to enjoy resource benefits in the long term.</p><p>[vi] Compensation may be appropriate in some contexts but is not relevant in other contexts. Compensation assumes general agreement on the involved agents (i.e. the polluter and those adversely affected), on the harm, loss or risk at stake, and on the presence of a reasonably level playing field. Such agreement cannot be assumed to exist where people assert diverse collective identities, have different understandings of what is at stake and deal with other on the background of entrenched economic, political and cultural inequalities. In such circumstances, efforts to tackle distributive issues need to be preceded by interventions promoting the recognition of marginalized groups and their democratic participation .</p><p>[vii] For example, the Pemón indigenous people in Venezuela seek recognition for their cultural knowledge of land management, in particular the customary use of fire. Financial compensation would not help to redress the injustices they have experienced by state interventions that have sought to reduce the use of fire,, and more generally marginalize their cultural knowledge and lifestyles. In Vietnam, Thái villages demand recognition of their historical authority over agricultural fields, in particular the capacity to re-allocate fields periodically in response to demographic changes – something that has nothing to do with compensation.</p><p>[viii] Poor villagers at the margin of physical survival may not feel that they have much of a choice when offered financial compensation, even if they had in return to give up justice demands of high immaterial importance. For example, Batwa communities are allowed to participate in tourism-based revenue sharing arrangements around protected areas of Uganda only if they consent to their exclusion from their own spiritual sites. Yet, few of them are in the position to deny such financially lucrative offers due to their impoverishment, even though the involved money amounts to only a marginal share of overall tourism profits. This is why the Ogoni people in the Niger delta see compensation as a palliative that does not serve justice. They instead demand recognition of their ownership of resources in their territory as well as an urgent clean-up of extreme pollution there.</p><p>[ix] Where populations cannot hold the governments and companies accountable that are causing harms, risks or losses, compensation is poorly positioned to serve justice. For example, people in Sudan and Ethiopia lack access to most fundamental information about the dam projects planned along the Nile. In China, most villagers are not aware of the legal rights granted to them by the central government, as strong as those rights may look on paper. Singaporeans affected by the haze due to forest fires in Indonesia similarly possess no means to hold the logging companies and agro-industrial plantations to account.</p><p>[x] There are many examples of what form such strategies can take, such as Indian mobilisations for the recognition of customary rights to resources and territories. Other examples come from the campaigns for the recognition of cultural rights to seed and customary knowledge in Latin America and struggles for community rights to land, forests and self-determination in Nepal. All these mobilisations demonstrate that environmental justice requires attention to issues of distribution, participation and recognition, linking individual economic and political rights with collective powers of self-determination and self-governance.</p><p>[xi] Restorative justice, in contrast to retributive justice that focuses on the law, tries to engage those who are harmed and affected communities, offering them a voice in processes and stressing dialogue and negotiation among the major parties with a stake in the dispute, in search of solutions that promote repair, reconciliation and the rebuilding of relationships . Demands made by plaintiffs (including members of the EJOLT project) that BP leave the same quantity of oil in the soil as was spilled in the Gulf of Mexico, is an example of a call for restorative, versus reparative, justice.</p>','THIS DECLARATION EMERGED FROM A WORKSHOP HELD AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA IN NORWICH, ENGLAND ON JUNE 20-22, 2013, ON GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE.\r\n \r\nWE, AN INTERNATIONAL GROUP OF ACTIVISTS, ACADEMICS AND RESEARCHERS, OBSERVE THAT ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICES ARE PROLIFERATING ACROSS THE GLOBE.\r\n','press_release',1373571056,1373571077),(57,'Nigeria’s Oil-Rich Delta Boils Over Longstanding Grievances','','','article',1375171695,1375171695),(58,'Two Years after the UNEP Report: Ogoni Still Groans','','','article',1375393648,1375393648),(59,'OGONI ENVIRONMENT: THE DEMAND FOR A STATE OF EMERGENCY.','<p>As environmental right groups the world over sadly draw attention to the pains, misery and loss of livelihood in Ogoniland resulting from decades of reckless oil exploitation and massive pollution of their environment by Shell, Social Action working with Ogoni Solidarity Forum (OSF), Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF) and other community groups has called for an urgent declaration of a state of emergency on the Ogoni environment.<br><br>Addressing thousands of Ogoni people and others who gathered at Bori, the traditional headquarters of Ogoni people to commemorate the second anniversary of the release of  UNEP  Audit Report on Ogoni environment,  Comrade AkpoBari Celestine, an environmental/human rights Campaigner on behalf of the groups condemned what he called a criminal silence of the Nigerian Government and Shell on the implementation of that report (also referred to as a death sentence)  two years after its release.<br><br>The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), on the request of the Federal Government of Nigeria carried out an assessment of oil pollution in Ogoniland following over 50 years of petroleum exploitation.  UNEP’s Ogoni report, which was released on 4 August 2011 showed massive and widespread pollution of land areas and wetlands of Ogoniland by Shell and the Nigerian government owned NNPC (Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation). <br><br>The report showed that Ogoni communities are exposed to petroleum hydrocarbons in outdoor air and drinking water, sometimes at elevated concentrations. Since average lifeexpectancy in Nigeria is less than 50 years, it is a fair assumption that most members of the current Ogoniland community have lived with chronic oil pollution throughout their lives.  Of most immediate concern, community members are drinking water from wells contaminated with benzene, a known carcinogen, at levels over 900 times above the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline and 1000 times above Nigerian drinking water standards<br><br>Benzene was detected in all air samples at concentrations ranging from 0.155 to 48.2 μg/m3. Approximately 10 per cent of detected benzene concentrations in Ogoniland were higher than the concentrations WHO and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) report as corresponding to a 1 in 10,000 cancer risk. <br><br>In 49 samples tested, UNEP observed severe contamination with hydrocarbons in soil at depths of at least 5m. In other sites, up to 8 cm layer of refined oil was observed floating on the groundwater, which serves the community wells – their source of drinking water. In at least seven wells examined, the hydrocarbon contamination is at least 1,000 times higher than the Nigerian drinking water standard of 3 μg/l. Surface water throughout the creeks in the area also contains high levels of hydrocarbons. <br><br>UNEP also discovered that oil pollution in many intertidal creeks has left mangroves denuded of leaves and stems, leaving roots coated in a bitumen-like substance sometimes 1 cm or more thick. Mangroves are spawning areas for fish and nurseries for juvenile fish and the extensive pollution of these areas is impacting the fish life-cycle. Crops in areas directly impacted by oil spills are damaged, and root crops, such as cassava, become unusable. <br><br>The report states that this contamination warrants emergency action ahead of all other remediation efforts. Hydrocarbon contamination was found in water taken from 28 wells at 10 communities adjacent to contaminated sites. <br><br>UNEP identified that one of the most serious consequences of Shell’s lack of an effective clean up was severe contamination of groundwater, putting communities health at serious risk<br><br>What is shocking is that in spite of above life threatening recommendations by UNEP, the government of Nigeria and the Polluter –Shell have both chosen to remain silent while the people are allowed to die in their numbers as a result of hunger and the poisonous environment they find themselves.<br><br>Of recent, Shell in a bit to run away from its responsibility has been claiming that illegal activities such as bunkering and sabotage, were the main causes of oil spill in Ogoni and other Niger Delta communities but the company has an obligation to prevent tampering of its facilities and they have all it takes to protect their over aged pipeline and well heads across the delta. Again, the company of late, has been selling off its assets in Nigeria while the mess is left behind.<br><br>Since, the release of the UNEP Report on Ogoniland on August 4, 2011, the government of Nigeria has been paying lip-service to the Clean-Up recommended. However, on receiving the report, President Goodluck Jonathan set up a Presidential Implementation Committee (PIC), jointly headed by the Minister of Petroleum Resources, Diezani Allison-Madueke (who is chair of the Board of NNPC and a former executive of Shell) and the Minister of Environment to study the report and advise the federal government on the best pathway. Following the recommendations of the PIC, which was not made known to the Ogoni, The Federal Government set up the “Hydrocarbon Pollution Restoration Project (HYPREP)” on July 24, 2012 to Clean-Up the entire Niger Delta. But HYPREP had not done any work in Ogoni and elsewhere as at January 2013. No provision was made for the work of HYPREP in the 2013 budget of the federal government of Nigeria.<br><br>DEMANDS<br>At the event, the people made the following demands:-<br><br>-that a state of emergency be declared immediately on the Ogoni environment and the area, tagged a “Disaster Territory”<br><br>-Clean up all oil spills to internationally accepted standards, and in consultation with the community, and ensure independent verification of the clean-up. <br><br>-that Shell stops ongoing sale of its oil wells until polluted sites are cleaned up and adequate compensation paid to affected persons and families.<br><br>-that the Federal Government of Nigeria scraps HYPREP for the establisment of Ogoni Environmental Restoration Agency as recommended by UNEP.<br><br>-that the Federal Government of Nigeria immediately make public names of persons already employed by HYPREP.<br><br><br></p>','As environmental right groups the world over sadly draw attention to the pains, misery and loss of livelihood in Ogoniland resulting from decades of reckless oil exploitation and massive pollution of their environment by Shell, Social Action working with Ogoni Solidarity Forum (OSF), Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF) and other community groups has called for an urgent declaration of a state of emergency on the Ogoni environment.\r\n\r\n','article',1375697343,1375697343),(60,'All in place for Inaugural Home School','<p>HOMEF’s Sustainability Academy (HOME School) arrives with a promise to challenge business as usual unpacking of the climate crisis and the Looming Food Crisis.

Blame President Correa','<p><strong>By Joan Martinez-Alier, Nnimmo Bassey and Patrick Bond</strong></p><p>As it was expected since February 2013 when president Correa won again the presidency of Ecuador, and even before given his track record since 2009 of internally boycotting the Yasuni ITT initiative, oil drilling has been announced in the ITT fields (Ishpingo, Tambococha, Tiputini) inside the Yasuni National Park in Ecuador. There is oil extraction in blocks 16 and 31 inside the Park already. The ITT is the last one to fall (depending now on the popular reaction in Ecuador and around the world).</p><p>Correa on 15th August blamed the rest of the world for not providing funds amounting to 3.6 billion dollars over 12 years (and therefore about one billion for the first three years) since the Trust Fund under UNDP auspices was formed on 3rd August 2010. True, some foreigners (and particularly minister of cooperation Dirk Niebel from Germany) bear a part of the blame. Norway and its Oil Fund (swimming in oil money) refused to help.</p><p>The proposal was for Ecuador to renounce to extraction of about 850 million barrels of oil (about 9 days of world extraction), preserve unparalled biodiversity, preserve the rights of local indigenous peoples and avoid carbon emissions of about 410 million tons of CO2. Ecuador asked for about half the forgone revenues of over 7 billion USD at present value. Hence the figure of 3.6 billion USD for outside contribution, under principles of co-responsability. Up to now, the money collected amounts only to tens of million dollars in actual fact, plus formal promises of about 300 million, which is not bad.</p><p>Correa now stated solemnly yesterday in Quito, “we have waited long enough”, “the world has failed us”, we need the oil to fight poverty, no damage will be done to the environment, the oil in ITT is worth nearly 20 billion dollars at present value and a few other lies. He dismissed art. 71 of the 2008 Constitution of Ecuador giving rights to nature. In fact, Correa has failed the world.</p><p>It is well known that the president Correa himself never liked the proposal, that came from environmental groups like Acción Ecológica and others in Ecuador and from Alberto Acosta, when he was minister for energy and mines in 2007. True, Correa has sometimes spoken eloquently in favour of the Yasuni ITT Initiative. But in practice in December 2009 he boycotted the signature of the MoU for the Trust Fund with UNDP, he did not go to the COP in Copenhagen himself where this signature was to take place in front of the world press, he then forced the resignation of the competent Ecuadorian team (Roque Sevilla, Yolanda Kakabadse) and his own minister for foreign relations, ecological economist Fander Falconi. Later, in August 2010, when the Trust Fund was finally set up, he did not appear at the signature of the agreement with UNDP in Quito, he merely sent his vicepresident.</p><p>In the meantime since 2010 feeble attempts have been made by a second rate team in Quito to collect some funds from abroad, while preparations in situ for drilling in Tiputini were increasingly obvious for all to see. Now, the only hope that remains is the reaction from the people of Ecuador. The Yasuni ITT has been very popular inside the country. Fander Falconí, who rejoined the government in 2011, has resigned again. It remains to be seen whether there are any other resignations from ministers from Alianza PAIS, Correa’s party.</p><p>We know that concentration of CO2 in the world is reaching 401 ppm, that nothing or too little is being done by the world political and economic powers against climate change, that the Amazon is being deforested in all the frontiers in Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela… The Amazon is one of the worst places in the world to drill for oil. There is danger to the lives of indigenous peoples. The ITT oil is of bad quality, heavy oil, and it will produce terrible pollution locally while, when burnt in the importing countries, it will of course produce CO2.</p><p><strong> Reaction from Nnimmo Bassey </strong><br> The excuse of the president that the world failed Ecuador is weak and lame. He failed the peoples of Ecuador and the world. This act brings to the fore the critical struggle that we must wage around the world to ensure that elected officials do not usurp our sovereignty after being sworn into office. And the protests that greeted the announcement is a sign that the people of Ecuador are clear about the fact that the decision to allow the assault on Yasuni ITT is not with the consent of the people.</p><p>Of course the people of Ecuador have not forgotten the tragedy of oil extraction as exemplified by the mess that Texaco (Chevron) left there. How would they forget when Chevron has shrugged off the fines that the court in Ecuador slammed on them for their massive environmental misbehaviour? President Correa is aware of the unwillingness of the oil companies to respect the rights of the peoples and the environment and yet he is set to open up the remaining tracts of the pristine environment in his country.</p><p>A basic problem of the Yasuni ITT proposal was that it was hinged on donations of cash in exchange of not extracting the crude. We agree it was the best option for our environmental activist friends to push the idea of leaving the oil in the soil. The climate crisis is intensified by the use of fossil fuels, chief of which is crude oil. A critical step towards fighting global warming requires an urgent transition from dependence on fossil fuels. Rather than take that necessary step, political leaders, oil companies and financial speculators keep pushing for more crude oil fields – whether it is in the Arctic, in fragile ecosystems in Africa or in the Amazon. As oil fields diminish more extreme extraction he race for the bottom of barrel is intensifying and telling capital to respect the environment and the people is like asking Shylock not to demand his pound of flesh.</p><p>Oil in Yasuni ITT must be left in the soil, not because monies were not donated in exchange for 50% of the value of the crude, it must be left untapped for the reason of safeguarding the environment of the uncontacted peoples of who live there, to tackle global warming and generally to preserve the rich biodiversity in the area.</p><p>Life is more valuable than crude oil. No one can buy the planet and all she has to offer. All who value the planet, no matter where we are located, must defend Yasuni ITT. The Ecuadorian constitution recognizes the right of nature. Let us tell President Correa that opening up Yasuni ITT to the claws of the oil predators is a blatant abuse of nature and her rights.</p><p><strong> Reaction from Patrick Bond </strong><br> There are plenty of enemies of the progressive Yasuni initiative.</p><p>Everyone has a different political spin on this, but mine is that there should be appropriate “climate debt” payments from excessive greenhouse gas emitters to both</p><ul><li>those suffering climate loss&amp;damage (“polluters pay” – preferably via an arrangement such as the Basic Income Grant in those geographic areas affected so that the funding doesn’t go to elite politicians, multinational corporations and dubious aid agencies/NGOs as is currently on track in the Green Climate Fund), and</li><li>Southern countries’ governments and directly-affected peoples (e.g. Niger Delta residents) to “leave the oil under the soil, coal in the hole, tarsand in the land, fracking shale gas under the grass,” etc.</li></ul><p>Both those kinds of payments are central to climate justice, in my view, and with a Namibian Basic Income Grant pilot and Yasuni-as-ecodebt-downpayment, it seemed to me that the stage was set for a coming battle on how the promised $100 bn/year for the GCF might be better allocated. The film “The Bill” sets the German challenge nicely: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl7GI-Ku6d0 … please have a look to see how a narrative can emerge that moves from guilt to solidarity.</p><p>Now meet the Arschloch – Dirk Niebel, the German minister for cooperation – whose fingerprints are clearest on the Yasuni corpse, for the reason, he insists, that “Germany will not contribute to a fund that is based on the philosophy of ‘payment for non-action’.” Responding to intense pressure to assist in Yasuni, he did trickle down some euro (24 million is nothing to sneeze at), but instead of being part of a project to leave the oil under the soil, he’s only interested in market-oriented projects like REDD.</p><p>To learn more on the Yasuni ITTproposal and alternatives to oil extraction in places like this, see our recent report on the post-oil Civilisation or go straight to the policy recommendations we made in this briefing.</p><p>A reaction from Pablo Solon is here: http://pablosolon.wordpress.com/</p>','','article',1376900364,1376900364),(62,'HOME School 01(HS01).

Nnimmo Bassey welcomed the guests and gave a brief synopsis of HOMEF, on the occasion of her first outing. According to Nnimmo Bassey, “we believe we can instigate positive change and this is why we refer to our speakers as instigators.” He continued by saying: “if our sea level increases by 2 meters, even Benin City will go under and Eko Atlantic will be seen to be a folly.”  On Pablo Solon’s first visit to Nigeria, Rev’d Bassey also welcomed the ambassador to HOMEF and Nigeria. The former Minister for Environment, Hon. John Odey described climate change as a fact and urged Nigerian citizens to take into cognizance all three key aspects of development (environmental, economic and social) without neglecting one aspect for the other.<br><br>Comrade Baba Aye of Health Workers Union challenged the justice issues behind environmental devastation, stating that even if wealthy countries manage to pay their way out of destruction in Earth, poorer countries cannot afford to do so. In his words, “the people most affected are the working people. The reason we are where we are is that the powerful benefit from it. It is a power struggle; struggle for the self-emancipation of the working people.” He also mentioned that environmental disasters are issues of the present not the future. Prof. Oladipo, a Nigerian climate negotiator and expert contributed the need for Nigeria to build a pressure group that urges the government to be futuristic in its approach towards development. Dr. Eniola Ajayi, the Ekiti State Commissioner for Environment and Comrade Chido Onumah of African Center for Media &amp; Information Literacy expressed their desire to learn from Ambassador Solon.<br><br>The chief instigator, Pablo Solon was the ambassador of the Plurinational State of Bolivia to the United Nations from February 2009 to July 2011 and is the current Executive Director of the NGO, Focus on the Global South. Pablo Solon of Bolivia, who also serves on the advisory board of HOMEF spoke extensively during the session on the need for Africa to take active steps against climate change. “Africa is becoming the most exposed region in the world to the impacts of climate change”, Pablo began, and reiterated throughout his presentation the vulnerability of Africa to temperature changes. For instance, by 2025, the impact of climate change on water availability in Nigeria will drop to 1700 cubic meters of water per person per year from over 3000 in 1990. This means Nigeria is quickly approaching water scarcity.  <br><br>In addition, the displacement of people is key in the climate change discussion and so issues of civil wars and uprising are of concern. It is predicted that there will be an increase of African civil wars by up to 54% due to climate change. And while it is possible to adapt to climate change to a certain extent, money is the deciding factor. So, poorer countries, with fewer emissions, will end up suffering the impacts the most. He concluded by giving practical and real solutions to the false solutions of GMOs, ocean fertilization, synthetic biology, stratospheric sulfate injection and the like. His suggested solutions include leaving 2/3rd of fossil fuels in the ground, adopting zero waste strategies and dismantling military infrastructure.<br><br></p>','In Abuja, several key policy makers and NGO leaders gathered together at the Protea Apo Apartments for the first session of the Health of Mother Earth Sustainability Academy (HOME School) on the 19th of August, 2013.

This session rounds off the inaugural Health of Mother Earth Foundation’s Sustainability Academy also known as HOME School.</p><p>Although global warming has become a major cause for concern in Nigeria as well as all over the world, large numbers of our peoples are still quite ignorant of what it is all about. No doubt people recognise that weather events such as rainfall and flooding are getting more intense. They can even tell you the rhythms of the weather have become unpredictable. Our people have also noticed an increase in climate-sensitive diseases and other immediate impacts of climate change. However, when it comes to saying what is responsible for climate change the answers taper out. If we do not know the cause and those responsible it is doubtful that we can solve the problem.</p><p>There are also some that have knowledge of the causes as well as the culprits of the looming catastrophic consequences and yet stay silent. Indeed when they are ready to speak they focus on drainage clearance, tree planting and clearance of refuse. While these are important, they are elementary environmental problems and it is a shame that we should still be grappling with them at this age.</p><p>Effective communication of climate change and the looming food crisis will help us unpack the problem, outline true and false solutions to the crises and assist in preparing a strategy for action. In this session our eco-instigator, Pablo Solon, will examine both local and global contexts of the problems. In the follow-up conversation at this session we hope ways of effectively communicating the climate crisis will be outlined. We hope that concepts like Reducing Emissions From Deforestation and Forest Degradation in developing countries (REDD), Clean Development Mechanisms (CDM) and other market-based false solutions would be exposed for what they are. Projects like Eko Atlantic must be interrogated as a climate challenge, not a solution, recognising the fact of sea level rise and the low-lying nature of Nigeria’s vulnerable coastline.</p><p>Communicating climate change is enhanced when the rather complex problem is explained from a creative and multidisciplinary base. It requires the uncovering of climate rhetoric that confuse the issues and expose vulnerable nations and peoples to the heavy impacts of global warming. In doing this, it is vital to clearly outline our audience and target groups must include communities, youths, and social movements including faith-based groups. It is essential to focus also on policy makers and the business community. The communication of global warming must include the historical roots of the crisis and the historical responsibilities of polluters who have foisted the problem on the world. The links with impending food loses must be understood and the sneaky moves by purveyors of genetically engineered crops as climate-smart must be uncovered and denounced.</p><p>It is important to communicate that the Stone Age did not end for lack of stones and that the fossil fuels age will not have to wait until the last fossil fuel has been burnt before we transit from it. The current dependence on fossil fuels has been seen to be the major cause of global warming. The World Bank, the International Energy Agency and others have said that at least 80% of known fossil fuels reserves must be left untapped/unburnt if we are to have an 80% chance of avoiding a temperature increase of up to 2oC. The fact that oil companies and oil dependent governments would not pay heed to this warning indicates that leaders are so stuck in the present that they cannot see how they are jeopardizing the future of our children and generations to come.</p><p>The same must be said about gas flaring in Nigeria and elsewhere. This obnoxious act is harmful to the planet and to human health besides being an obscene economic waste. Every nation must play a part in the flight against Global warming. Even where we speak of climate justice and climate debt, we cannot justify inaction or actions that compound the crisis on the basis that we want to catch up with the polluters. There is nothing like catch-up justice!</p><p>Temperature increases of the magnitude that are now a possibility because of refusal of polluting nations to commit to measurable and verifiable emissions cut must be clearly communicated. Africa is poised to heat up much more than other regions. Continuous temperature rise because of lack of commitment of nations to cut emissions at source will translate to the roasting of Africa, an already very vulnerable continent. Food production capacity will also be diminished, exposing the continent to great dangers.</p><p>HOMEF is an ecological think tank that aims to connect the sectorial dots in our struggle for a safe, sane and secure environment in which humans live in solidarity and in dignity. Article 5 of the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights (1981) assures us that Every individual shall have the right to the respect of the dignity inherent in a human being. To achieve these HOMEF provides an inclusive space for environmental, youth, women, social, labour, faith-based and other justice communities to join hands in holistic struggles to secure the rights of our peoples and of our environment.</p><p>We have chosen to focus on climate change and the looming food crisis in this maiden session because Africa is in the line of fire of climate impacts. Through this and other sessions of our Sustainability Academy we will strive to uncover the roots of political and ecological problems confronting us and proffer solutions that will help heal our planet. Our Sustainability Academy is designed as a multi-city academy with the objective of ensuring sufficient spread of the ideas but in terms of diverse locations but also with regard to the social groupings participating.</p><p>We have in our midst today Pablo Solon who served as ambassador of the Plurinational State of Bolivia to the United Nations 2009-2011 and was his country’s lead negotiator at the United Nation’s Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of Parties (COPs 15 and 16) at Copenhagen and Cancun. His principled stand on climate justice and the rights of nature to maintain its cycles were exemplary and remain so today.</p><p>After the failure of the Copenhagen COP, Solon played a key role in his nation’s convening of the World Peoples Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth at Cochabamba, in April 2010. For once we saw a clear convergence between politics and environmental defense at the highest national level – with President Evo Morales in the driving seat. The major outcomes of the Peoples’ Summit were the People’s Agreement on Climate Change as well as the draft Universal Declaration on the Rights of Mother Earth.

But during the same period, though largely ignored by the mainstream media, there were mounting protests, demonstrations and actions by citizens in a number of other African countries including Algeria, Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Djibouti, Gabon, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Somalia, Senegal, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Togo, Uganda, Western Sahara, Zimbabwe3. While many of these have not (yet) been on a scale witnessed in either Tunisia or Egypt, the fact is that the events in these countries represent qualitative changes in the political and social environment. And yet these events have received little media attention. The only significant exceptions seem to be in the case of Côte d’Ivoire, Libya, Somalia and Mali where Western governments have been involved in military interventions; Senegal where mass protests, especially by youth, prevented former president Abdulaye Wade from establishing his dynasty; South Africa where striking miners in the Lonmin platinum mines were massacred. Even in these instances, the perspective of the media has been, I would suggest, strongly biased towards propagating the narrative of power – corporate and imperial power.</strong></em></p><p>Registration for HS02 is now open and you are invited to register to be a part of either the session that will hold in Lagos or in Port Harcourt in November 2013.

Akpobari&#39;s statement opened the debates on the palpable inaction of the Nigerian government on the UNEP Report submitted to it on 4 August 2011. While the Ogoni people generally see the report as a confirmation of a death sentence long foretold, even those who see it in less apocalyptic terms agree that foot dragging over the report more than two years after it&#39;s publication does not show any good intentions towards the people by either the Nigerian State or the direct culprit, SPDC, who has not denied being the polluter of Ogoni environment.</p><p><img src=\"http://www.homef.org/sites/default/files/monikaspeaking.jpg\">During the event, Monika Griefahn, a co-chair of the Right Livelihood Award Foundation emphasized that that a fundamental step to cleaning the Niger Delta environment is ensuring that new spills do not occur. A situation where new spills keep occurring as they do in the Niger Delta means that the problems keep getting compounded and efforts cannot be as effective as they ought to be. She also recalled that when she was a kid her town in Germany had a highly polluted environment, but that with converted efforts, right policies and enforcement of regulations the air air, the waters and the land were cleaned up. She is optimistic that with the right political will and with an understanding of the urgency the situation requires the Ogoni environment as well as that of the entire Niger Delta can be rescued.</p><p>The Roundtable was jointly hosted by Social Action (SA), Ogoni Solidarity Forum (OSF) and Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF). Although the UNEP report was on the Ogoni environment, this Roundtable drew participants from across the Niger Delta, showing a clear understanding that the struggle to clean up Ogoni is a struggle to clean up the entire region. The debates at the event were robust and resolutions reached included the immediate implementation of the UNEP report, scrapping of the anachronistic HYPREP and the setting up of the agency recommended by UNEP. It also decried the installation of signposts telling Ogoni people to keep off their territory without any indication as to where they should stay or go and without alternative sources of water other than the heavily polluted ones they are forced to depend on. The Roundtable asserted that what has happened in Ogoni is nothing short of ecocide and that what has been recorded there is emblematic of what the situation is across the Niger Delta.</p><p>The Roundtable was the last in series of events that commenced on Monday 25 November 2013 at the University of Port Harcourt. On that first day, the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) establishing the Right Livelihood College campus at the University of Port Harcourt was signed by the parties involved: the Right Livelihood Awards Foundation, the University and the Health of Mother Earth Foundation.

They will also have the benefit of drawing from the large pool of RLAF laureates as resource persons for these efforts. Thus far the Right Livelihood Award has been given to 153 individuals/organizations from 64 countries. The Dean of the Faculty, Professor Alapiki stressed the need for scholars to make full use of the opportunities the collaboration would open.</p><p>While making opening remarks at the event, Nnimmo Bassey, director of HOMEF, likened to “living in a laboratory of contestations and experimentations birthed by failed promises, dashed hopes, brutalised lives and a thoroughly polluted environment.” He went on to add, “We are hopeful that there will be more scholarship in the areas of fusing the sciences to expose the systemic root-causes of societal challenges. In particular we are hopeful that scholars will take intense look into the mix of our challenges through political, ecological, cultural, economic and technological change.” He noted that the University of Port Harcourt’s location in the oil capital of Nigeria gives it the opportunity to “provide hands-on scholarship on the impunity and rampage that has left this territory to be infamously known as one of the top ten most polluted places on the planet.”</p><p>The maiden Right Livelihood lecture at the University of Port Harcourt was given by Dr Monika Griefahn to an audience made mostly of post graduate students desirous of taking advantage of the coming if the campus to their doorsteps. Griefahn has a background as a founding member and co-director of Greenpeace Germany from 1980 to 1983. She is active in politics and has been a member of parliament and has served as Minister for the Environment in the German Stare of Lower Saxony from 1990 to 1998.</p><p>In her lecture she highlighted the works of some past winners of the RLA - including Ken Saro-Wiwa/MOSOP in 1994. Another laureate she highlighted was Wangari Maathai of Kenya who won the award in 1984, and later won the Nobel Peace Prize 20 years later. Stressed that some of the solutions to nagging social and environmental problems championed by the laureates could easily be replicated in Nigeria. One of the examples she cited was the supply of solar power in Bangladesh and the training of women to carry out the installations in a society were men may not have access to certain compounds because of religious and cultural restrictions.</p><p><img src=\"http://www.homef.org/sites/default/files/noble.jpg\">Noble Wadzah of Oilwatch Ghana was the Instigator of the second Sustainability Academy (also known as Home School) of HOMEF. He spoke on the topic: African Uprisings and the implications for the Environment. In his presentation, Mr Wadzah reviewed the flames that ignited the Arab Spring and wondered whether the rest of Africa has been shrouded in winter. He noted that the media had overlooked several uprisings. He also called to mind the colonial and neocolonial roots of the simmering discontent with leaders who are more or less agents of the old order on the continent.</p><p>He challenged academics to become more involved in the struggles for environmental justice because the struggle requires teamwork with all social forces. According to him, The Arab Spring has been only partially unpacked and usually from the political power struggles perspective only. He posited that there are other dimensions to the story, including the environmental struggle for justice that we are all confronted with. &#34;As Africans we are all connected by confrontations with intense forces of extractive activities. We therefore need to challenge institutions, develop new thinking that takes into account our shared values of communal well being.”</p><p>The lecture plus Sustainability Academy ended on a high note with closing remarks by Dr. Eme Ekekwe, acting Head of Department of Political Sciences. His words: “What we have done here today is a wakeup call on two levels; academic and personal. The Dean has spoken about the academic part; there are scholarships and our graduate students are in a position to take advantage of those opportunities...We are to supply the intellectual needs for the practical struggle that is taking place out there. Sometimes in this country, it is not the academics and intellectuals who should be leading; it is the artisans, farmers, fishermen. It is those people whose fishing waters are being polluted, those people whose lands are been grabbed and appropriated not only by the multinationals but by our own people.”</p><p>Tuesday 26 November 2013 was devoted to visiting locations in Ogoni to see progress made in expected clean up efforts since the publication of the UNEP Report. First port of call was Goi, a community completely devastated by major oil spill and fire in 2004. Goi was once a vibrant community, now it lies silent, desolate. Schools, bakeries, fishponds, homes and other physical developments are fast fading into memory. The only building being put into occasional use in this village is the Community Hall. We were received in that hall during our visit. Soon after opening and welcoming prayers were said the community head presented us with a tuber of yam he had harvested from a nearby farm. It was a dead, stiff tuber of hydrocarbons. It gave a semblance of yam but was nothing close to that. It told a story of the pathetic life the Ogoni people have been sentenced to live. The yams, cassava and other crops look green and healthy, but that is as far as it goes. They look alive, but they are dead.</p><p>At Bodo,as at Goi, the smell of hydrocarbons fill the air. The water body here, like that of Goi is completely coated in crude, you could fill your tank by just scooping the stuff right there, Dr Griefahn said in shock. She had seen videos and documentaries of the Niger Delta, but standing in the mire and seeing that people have no option but to live in that environment must have left a mark. One telling sign of absolute optimism besides the people persisting in farming when they know the harvest would be bitter, is the sight of people starting new buildings right on the edges of the polluted waters with no chance of occupants of such buildings hoping to breath fresh air in their lifetime. Yet they build.</p><p>Before we headed to the Bodo waterfront we paid a courtesy call on HRH King Berebon, the new Paramount ruler of Bodo city and seized the visit to pay our condolences over the passing on of of father and former paramount ruler, His Royal Highness, King Felix Sunday Bebor Berebon. The king expressed the resoluteness of the Bodo people to fight for their rights and to ensure that their environment is cleaned. He informed that Bodo City is a cosmopolitan city where everyone is welcome and then suggested there might be an historical link between them and another Bodo located in Norway. We cannot say much on that right now, but there are moves to make a friendship connection between the two cities.</p><p>From Bodo we moved to Bori where excerpts from Ken Saro-Wiwa&#39;s last writings were read from his new book Silence Would Be Treason. The book comprises some poems and 28 letters written to Sister Majella McCarron from prison between 20 October 1993 and 14 September 1995 shows Saro-Wiwa as a man who deeply loved his people and who was concerned that they hadn&#39;t had sufficient time to strengthen different levers of leadership before the beast of State was unleashed on them. He was a man fully convicted or convinced on what he believed and who had no regrets that he was exposed to extreme risks by his resolute stand for justice.</p><p>The day was rounded off with a play, This Land is Not for Grabs written and performed by Ogoni youths. The short play showed how political leaders buy up community leaders and by so doing open up the plunder of the people&#39;s heritage and resources. The play further showed that even though individuals pay heavy and bitter price in the struggle for justice, the will of the people ultimately triumphs. As the slogan goes, &#34;a people united can never be defeated.&#34;</p>','\"To destroy a people, you destroy their environment.\" This was a statement made by Celestine Akpobari, a participant at the recently concluded Roundtable on the UNEP Report held in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. A reflection on this statement helps an understanding of the basis of impunity as planned and intentional infractions against the planet and its people.','article',1386153360,1386154842),(80,'International Civil Society Statement of Concern on the Commercialization of Bt Brinjal','<p>To:<br>Sheikh Hasina<br>Prime Minister of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh<br>Dr Hasan Mahmud<br>Minister for Environment and Forests<br>Ministry of Environment and Forests, People’s Republic of Bangladesh<br><br>Copy to:<br>Md Abdul Hamid<br>President of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh<br>Begum Khaleda Zia<br>Leader of the Opposition<br>Parliament of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh<br><br>12 December 2013<br><br>We, various non-governmental organizations, farmers’ organizations, consumer groups, and independent scientific organizations from different parts of the world, are writing to express our serious concerns over the planned commercialization of Bt brinjal, genetically engineered to produce acry1Ac-like toxin, in Bangladesh.<br>This is the same Mahyco-Monsanto Bt brinjal that was stopped in India, and its history there is highlyrelevant. The self-assessed dossier submitted by Mahyco-Monsanto was subjected to a comprehensive appraisal by several leading international scientists who examined the raw data. They found that biosafety studies, which were claimed to have been conducted, were essentially not done.<br>The international appraisal of the raw data was only made possible when the dossier was forced into the public domain by an Order of the Supreme Court of India. We are concerned that the same dossier may have been submitted to Bangladesh for approval, when it has been shown in India to be<br>essentially fraudulent.<br>WE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU TO SUSPEND THE PLANNED COMMERCIALIZATION OF BT BRINJAL FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS:<br>1. Contamination and threats to biodiversity. Bangladesh has a vast native diversity of brinjal. As brinjal is largely cross-pollinated, transgene contamination poses a big problem in protecting the natural biodiversity as well as local varieties of brinjal. The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety recognizes the crucial importance to humankind of centres of origin and centres of genetic diversity.<br>Bangladesh, as a Party to the Cartagena Protocol and a centre of diversity of brinjal should therefore take a precautionary approach to Bt brinjal, and not approve its commercialisation.<br><br>2. Food safety and the right to safe food. On 29 September 2013, the High Court of Bangladesh directed the government not to release Bt brinjal without assessing the possible health risks. The court ordered the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI), agriculture secretary and health secretary to submit a progress report within three months, after conducting independent research focusing on the health safety issues in line with the GM food standards set by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, a joint FAO-WHO body.<br><br>An independent analysis by eminent international scientists, submitted to the Prime Minister, has said that “Bt Brinjal will have negligible benefit but would present an enormous hazard to human health. It would be profound disservice to Bangladesh if Bt Brinjal were allowed to enter her food supply...There are at least four mechanisms by which the introduction of the Bt toxin gene into the Brinjal genome can cause harm. These include (1) the random insertion of the Bt gene into the plant DNA and the resulting unintended consequences, (2) alterations in crop metabolism by the Bt protein that results in new, equally unintended and potentially toxic products, (3) the direct toxicity of the Bt<br>protein, and (4) an immune response elicited by the Bt protein”. It is clear that Bt Brinjal poses significant health risks and that further study is needed.<br><br>3. Lack of information and consultation. We understand that civil society organizations within Bangladesh have requested the compiled toxicological test results from the accredited laboratories on mammals, fish, rabbits and the results of nutritional composition analysis of Bt brinjal as submitted to the Biosafety Core Committee. Unfortunately, we understand that this information has not yet been provided. In addition, we understand that there has been no public consultation on this issue. As a Party to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, Bangladesh has international legally-binding obligations to ensure access to information and public consultation in the decision-making process regarding<br>living modified organisms such as Bt brinjal.<br>Bt brinjal poses a serious threat to biodiversity and health, and this has been recognized by other countries in the region. In India, on 9 February 2010 after a series of public hearings and consultations with different stakeholders, the then Minister of Environment, Honorable Jairam Ramesh, imposed a moratorium on the release of Bt brinjal due to food safety, food security, and loss of biodiversity considerations. He said, “It is my duty to adopt a cautious, precautionary principle-based approach and impose a moratorium on the release of Bt-brinjal, till such time independent scientific studies establish, to the satisfaction of both the public and professionals, the safety of the product from the point of view of its long-term impact on human health and environment, including the rich genetic wealth existing in brinjal in our country.”<br>In the Philippines, on 20 September 2013, the Court of Appeals (CA) upheld the ruling preventing the government from conducting field testing of Bt talong (brinjal). The decision of the Court of Appeals (17 May 2013) to stop the field testing of Bt talong was based on the Constitutional right to a balanced and healthful ecology. According to the CA, this right consists of: “(a) right to one&#39;s health which should not be put to risk by willful disturbance of ecological balance. This speaks of threats to human health which, in the case of bt talong field trials, had not yet been assessed and categorically declared as safe for humans. And (b) the right to live in an environment of balanced ecological relations which concerns the people&#39;s right to a balanced ecology which presupposes that all living things, as they are naturally ordained, are equally necessary to maintain the balance. The field trials of Bt talong could not be declared by this Court as safe to human health and to ecology, with full scientific certainty, being an alteration of an otherwise natural state of affairs of ecology”.<br><br>We, therefore, ask the Government of Bangladesh to:<br>1. Adopt a precautionary approach and suspend the commercialization of Bt brinjal as directed by the Bangladesh High Court.<br>2. Release all information related to the development and testing of Bt brinjal.<br>3. Conduct meaningful and effective public consultation processes among the different<br>stakeholders at the local and national levels, who will be affected by the possible release of Bt brinjal.<br><br>Signed by:<br>1. &#34;No Patents on Life!&#34;, Germany<br>2.

No REDD! No to using Rice for Carbon Markets!','<p>Bali, Indonesia - December 6th, 2013</p><p>We, the undersigned Indigenous Peoples, peasants, fisherfolks, immigrants, women, youth, cooks and civil society of the world gathered in Bali to protest the WTO, know that rice is a sacred staple crop which feeds billions of peoples worldwide. We, who courageously resist efforts to impose the use of genetically modified so-called “Golden Rice” of Monsanto, now unite to defend rice from being used as a part of capitalism of nature and carbon markets - “REDD Rice”.</p><p>Since 2007, the United Nations, World Bank and fossil fuel polluters like Shell and Chevron and mining company Rio Tinto, have been pushing a carbon trading regime called REDD1 (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation). REDD uses agricultural land, soils, forests and tree plantations as sponges for greenhouse gas emissions. Now these climate polluters want to use rice as an offset for their pollution instead of reducing emissions at source. Market-based solutions for addressing the climate crisis are a false solution.</p><p>We do not want our rice paddies or rice beds to be excuses for more pollution which causes global warming and typhoons. For peasant farmers, REDD+ constitutes a worldwide counter-agrarian reform and perverts the task of growing food into “farming carbon.” The UN and northern industrialized countries have introduced other false solutions to climate change such as “Climate-Smart Agriculture”. In Africa, where climate-smart carbon credit projects are being promoted, peasant farmers are starting to resist the use of their lands and soil for carbon sequestration, which is a carbon market scheme of capitalism. These new soil carbon markets are opening the door for more GMO crops and land grabs.</p><p>“Climate-ready” seeds and other supposed GMO climate fixes like “REDD Rice” are just more attempts of the biotech industry and agribusiness to deform, patent and control our seeds, grab our fields, privatize our soils and turn us into landless, indentured servants of capitalism.</p><p>Slated for next spring 2014, California may include rice cultivation as carbon offsets in its climate change law known as California’s Global Warming Solutions Act (AB32). The proposed rice cultivation offset protocol will pretend to reduce emissions through a cropland agricultural protocol using for the first time, a BIO- GEO-CHEMICAL model, which supposedly “emulates” soil processes. One of the methods for supposedly cutting emissions is to replace wet seedlings with dry seedlings. This will include growing GMO rice and the use of genetically modified &#34;soil nutrients&#34;.</p><p>China and California would be working with biotechnology companies that would privatize, patent and sell genes that supposedly allow rice plants to use less fertilizer. As part of economic globalization, this gene-knowledge and rice offsets would be sold to the highest bidder to meet their emissions reduction targets on the emerging global market for carbon credits.</p><p>If applied on a massive scale, genetically modified REDD Rice could contaminate rice farmers’ lands and seeds with enormous adverse environmental, social and cultural consequences.</p><ul><li>No to Privatization and Commodification of Rice!</li><li>No WTO of our RICE!</li><li>No WTO of Nature, Food and Life!</li><li>NO REDD Rice!  Honoring our martyrs who have fallen for defending our land and territories, we commit to defend rice as Life and part of our movement for food sovereignty.</li></ul><p> </p><p>We oppose using rice as part of the carbon market.

When he declared in the dock that We All Stand Before History, he was as prescient as any prophet could be. Today we see clearly that keeping silent in the face of ecological destruction is treason. Ken Saro-Wiwa was a man of many dreams. He was murdered, but as is universally accepted, even if you kill the messenger, you cannot kill the dream. Today we are gathered here to interrogate the turmoil in Africa and seek to find out what the roots are and whether there is are common factors connecting them. We want to ask the questions: when, where and why did the rain begin to drench us. How could storm clouds gather and yet we say there would be no rain? Ken Saro-Wiwa declared this an ecological war.</blockquote><p>He also mentioned the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Report of August 4, 2011, which presented a damning assessment of the Ogoni environment. The report uncovered that the Ogoni environment has been so damaged that rather than support lives and livelihoods, it was killing the Ogoni people. The UNEP report confirmed the alarming fact that all the water bodies in Ogoni are polluted with hydrocarbons and a variety of deadly elements including carcinogens. The pollution is so deep that it would require twenty-five years of work to decontaminate the waters so that people can safely drink and use the resources found in them.</p><p>Bassey explained that the Sustainability Academy was arranged to provide a space for the examination of the impacts of political crises and uprising on the environment and on environmental policies. As an example of how violent conflicts translate to undesirable environmental outcomes he cited recent calls for the clearing of the Sambisa forest to facilitate locating and recuing of the abducted Chibok girls. While, he commended efforts to locate the girls, he said that the forest is not the enemy or a hindrance to be dominated and the strategy for rescuing the young girls such not include the destruction of a 60,000 square kilometres forest.</p><p>He noted the popular #BringBackOurGirls campaign that has gone global and hoped that something can be achieved through the mobilisations that would go on beyond the release of the young girls: “Can a movement against violence become a movement for social, economic and environmental justice? We would waste a great opportunity if we stop at just the massive hashtag-and-photo-shoot campaigns. This is a great moment to build an issues-centred political movement in Nigeria and in Africa. It is time to go beyond the hastag.”</p><p><strong>Abuja:</strong><br> In Abuja, policy makers, journalists and other civil society representatives participated in the kick-off session of the Third Sustainability Academy. Nnimmo Bassey expressed concern for the state of political unrest across Africa:</p><blockquote>&#34;Wars kill not only directly through bullets and bombs but also through diseases, destruction of the environment and livelihoods, increase in violent crimes, displacement of populations and unsustainable exploitation of resources. Conflicts also open possibilities for the re-colonisation of the continent, on our invitation, in the guise of military and economic assistance. We are seeing this unfolding in our nation and in other nations of Africa.&#34;</blockquote><p> </p><p>Nnimmo Bassey’s welcome address paved the way for the lecture delivered by the lead instigator for this session, Firoze Manji. The instigator began his lecture addressing the sense of despair on the continent due to frequent bouts of political uprising. However, he iterated that African is characterized by the twin brothers of hope and despair with Rwanda, Tunisia, Egypt, Angola and Togo as classic examples of such.</p><p>According to Manji, “It has been said that if you want to truly dispossess a people of their resources, you have to dispossess them of their history. We have been disconnected from our history and the danger is that any people without a history have no future.”</p><p>He concluded by criticizing the use of GDP to measure the economy of nations saying that it is not a measure of production but of extraction (water, oil, agriculture, minerals, etc). According to him, there is a need for Africa to undergo structural democratization to decide our futures. He highlighted the need to build structural solidarity in Africa and take the future in our hands.</p><p>Manji’s talk was followed by a very interactive session of questions, answers and comments.</p><p><strong>Bori:</strong><br> At the Bori session, Fynface D. Fynface and MC Solomon of Bori moderated the program including introducing the guests and the Director of HOMEF who later on introduced the Instigator, Firoze Manji. Officials of MOSOP and youths from Etche community in Rivers State were also introduced.</p><p>Nnimmo Bassey opened the session with thought-provoking welcome words on the topic under review, fully anchoring it on the Ogoni experience. In his words:</p><blockquote>“It is inspiring to see that the seeds sown by the martyrs of the Ogoni struggle continue to fire the imaginations of the marginalised peoples of the world and all those engaged in the epic battles for ecological sanity. Saro-Wiwa was an apostle of peaceful resistance and like others before him the arrows aimed at him by agents of multinational corporations and the governments that polish their bloody shoes did not cow him. His vision of an Ogoni ethnic nation of proud and dignified people lives on. Today everyone sees the Ogonis and marvel at the tenacity with which you all are committed to peaceful resistance in the face of ecological provocations and extreme pressures including those of land grabbing and outright violence.”</blockquote><p>The lead instigator, Firoze Manji, took up right from where Nnimmo Bassey left. He began his lecture with an exercise on Ken Saro Wiwa’s statement – “Silence is Treason”, during which the participants expressed their understanding of the statement as pertains to the Ogoni situation of ecological destruction. He went on to mention that financial development and extractive development (mining, extractive and agricultural factory industries) are the two most glorified types of development; none of which contribute to the actual advancement of people and their communities. “They pollute our land and our environment,” he said.</p><p> </p><p>Firoze Manji of ThoughtWorks continued:<br> From the beginning of the slave trade era, the British made a lot of money from sugar factories cultivated by slaves. Gradually, resistance was built and with revolutionaries like Amilcar Cabral, Thomas Sankara and others, the resistance was able to grow into independence from slavery. In Nigeria, similar struggles took place in Ogoniland. It was here they stopped the multinationals from exploitation; it was here that the people stood for justice and it was here that one of your own was sacrificed because of the struggles for justice.</p><p>Firoze Manji concluded with an allusion to the stock market in which he said Africans keep getting pushed around by the West’s version of democracy and the media. “We vote every four or five years and yet in the stock market, capitalists vote every day, every minute and every second and this is to decide the prices of food and resources.”</p><p>The talk was followed by a discussion session.</p><p><strong>Makoko:</strong><br> The choice of the venue – The Makoko Floating School, was surely a sharp detour from the usual serenity of a conference room as it was hosted on a symbolic venue in clear appreciation to the ingenuity of the people of Makoko having found a way to live in sync with nature despite the changing times and challenges around them. To get to the floating school participants took a canoe ride through the Makoko community – a community built on stilts. For some of the participants this was their first experience of taking a canoe ride passed fishermen and women, carpenters and other craftsmen working on water. It was indeed an eye opening experience for many who never imagined how the local people live in this deprived part of a megacity such as Lagos.</p><p>According to Nnimmo Bassey:</p><blockquote>“Makoko is a metaphor for resilience in the face of enormous pressures. This community floating on the waters of the Lagos Lagoon is resilient because it is not a rigid community. It is resilient not because the buildings in this community are the strongest in the world but because they are built in sync with nature and not against her. Her resilience is seen in the young boys and girls who ferry us in the boat taxis in order to make enough cash to pay their daily school fees and so access a measure of education.”</blockquote><p>He continued: “Makoko as a community sitting on water is prone to the impacts of sea level rise that could be triggered by intense rains or by global warming. Flooding is a challenge to Lagos, any day and the state pays a lot of attention to building resilience and also mitigating the impacts. However, Makoko teases the sea by sitting on it. The Floating School in which this session is being held speaks volumes about how to face sea level rise and deflect its sting. The School is designed and built to float. This means that if the sea rises, the building itself rises. This school is designed and built in line with the rhythms of nature and not in defiance of nature like Eko Atlantic does, for instance. The Floating School and the entire Makoko communities show us what resilience means.”</p><p>In all three sessions, extensive amounts of time were dedicated to questions and discussions among participants. Some questions are particularly striking as they reveal the concerns of participants with regards to the theme. One Abuja participant, Dr. Bell Ihua, asked if capitalism could be executed in a more effective and environmentally conscious manner. In response to the question, Mr. Firoze Manji explained that the system of capitalism is intricately designed to maximize profits and views natural endowments solely as resources. In his words, “we would need to change the name from capitalism if we change that.” Ms. Oge Finola asked how the masses can vote as often as the capitalist vote and in similar fashion, Mr. Manji responded that “the continued enhancement of the struggle is the best ballot with which the people vote.”</p><p>Participants in Bori expressed deep passion for the issue of ecological unrest in the Niger Delta as exemplified by Mr. Harrison F. Baridakaba’s question. He asked, “how long should we continue to obey the condition of non-violence?” The director of HOMEF, Mr. Nnimmo Bassey, in response to the question, urged all participants that “militancy and violence are not only by guns. However, no matter how violent a group becomes, they have to sit down on a table to discuss issues.” In Makoko, Lagos, one indigene praised the construction of the Floating School and urged the government to build such sustainable structures in the community.</p><p>In concluding the Third Sustainability Academy, HOMEF reiterated our key calls relative to the issues we have been interrogating as follows:</p><ol><li>African leaders must ensure that the continent gets out of the trap of being the arena for proxy wars by interests inimical to the well being of our environment and peoples</li><li>Ecological warfare must not be a tool in the war against terror. In this regard HOMEF endorses the demand: #BringBackOurGirls and adds that they must be brought back to a secure environment devoid of stigmatisation and exploitation in any guise including exploitation as child brides.</li><li>Nigerian and African leaders must protect our environment and peoples from the activities of rampaging resource extractors, ensure that environmental costs do not continue to be externalised to the people/environment and that ecological crimes are severely sanctioned</li><li>African governments must be primarily responsible and accountable to our peoples rather than to international financial institutions and to multinational corporations</li><li>The Nigerian government should scrap the Hydrocarbon Pollution Restoration Project (HYPREP) and replace it with a National Environmental Restoration Agency (NERA)under the Federal Ministry of Environment, with a mandate to clean up the Nigerian environment including in particular the Ogoni environment as demanded by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report issued three years ago</li><li>The Makoko Floating School model should be adopted and replicated across all coastal communities by the Nigerian government as a climate change adaptation measure and to teach the lesson that our architecture must support our ways of life and be in sync with the rhythms of nature.</li><li>The Nigerian and Lagos State governments should commit to upgrade the Makoko communities and provide support for the communities including by providing adequate health, educational and other services. The community should also be protected from property and financial speculators as well as from other disaster capitalists.</li></ol>','','article',1403453293,1403453293),(92,'Re-Source Democracy','','','publication',1403796793,1403796793),(93,'Not On Our Plates','<p>Nigeria does not need GMO crops and here are a few reasons why.</p>','','publication',1406090507,1421844340),(94,'GM promoters promote poverty and dependency in Africa','','','article',1406390398,1406390398),(95,'Eco~Instigator Issue #4','<p>In this issue:</p><ul><li>HS03 Reports</li><li>GMOss for food and nutrition security: a costly distraction</li><li>The challenge and threat of genetic engineering</li><li>Fine print of the food wars</li></ul><p>And more...</p>','','publication',1409128411,1409136681),(96,'HOMEF Annual Report','','','publication',1409301424,1409301456),(97,'Memories of Ogoni Prepare us for Future Battles ','','','article',1410644998,1410665985),(98,'Nnimmo Bassey Receives National Honour for Environmental Rights Activism','','','news',1412663849,1412671561),(99,'eco~Instigator Issue #5','<p>In this issue:</p><ul><li>Rethinking the resource question.</li><li>Development or Amputation: The role of extractive industries</li><li>The day we added ecocide to our vocabulary</li><li>Books you must read...</li></ul><p> </p>','','publication',1413798302,1413798302),(100,'Mining affected communities around the world say ‘No to Mining’ and seek to secure No Go Areas at the IUCN World Parks Congress ','','','press_release',1415850098,1415851024),(101,'BODO OIL SPILL AND THE CONFIRMATION OF SHELL’s GUILT','<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF) welcomes the agreement by Shell, to pay a penalty of about 55 million Pounds Sterling (about N16bn) to 15, 600 Bodo fishermen and community for the massive crude oil spills of 2008/2009.

Sadly, although the Bodo pollution also damaged the Goi community waters that community continues to languish in abject neglect without remedy.”</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">HOMEF sees the main victory in the case as its being a clear precedent, giving a case where Shell accepts liability and is not pretending to be making a pay-out on <em>humanitarian</em> basis as they have claimed in the past. “Since the oil companies do not respect fines imposed on them by Nigerian regulatory agencies, or even the National Assembly, this decision should encourage other communities to bring up cases against Shell and other oil companies operating in the Nigeria, Ghana and other countries,” says George Awudi, a member of the international Advisory Board of HOMEF.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Payment of compensation and building of schools and clinics will not by any means reduce the demand for an urgent clean-up of the Ogoni environment.

The change that has become our reality has not come about by accident. This change has been carefully planned, organized and orchestrated and the price has been dire. The driving force of the change we speak of has been greed and the power to exploit peoples and Nature without any sense of responsibility and with continually constricting space for redress. We live in a world that is not only unipolar but one in which a handful of corporations and entities control the global supply of food, water and power. In the quest for absolute control these corporations strive to merge and turn into behemoths of absolute power. Some of these corporations are already playing God by claiming to invent seeds and thus holding patents on the gifts of nature.</p><p>Oil companies and others locking the world into extractivism refuse to heed the call for tackling global warming at source by allowing 80 per cent of known fossil fuels reserves to remain underground and rather deny that global warming is happening; and when they agree it is happening they present a false path for action. False actions presented include carbon capture and storage, genetically modified crops, carbon trading mechanisms such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD) and geoengineering. These false solutions allow polluters to continue with their polluting acts and externalize the problems to vulnerable peoples and poor nations and communities through reckless pollution, land grabs and displacement of communities.</p><p>We are living in a chaotic, violent world. In history this violence has been marked by slavery, colonialism and imperialism. These continue today under different guises and are sugar-coated with the cloak of neoliberalism. Naked exploitation and despoliation remain the creed. Wars are prosecuted, nations are destroyed and people are massacred all for the purpose of securing access to oil, other fossil fuels and other resources to maintain an unsustainable lifestyle in a finite world. No wonder we see the sudden spike in interest on planets in other galaxies and universes that no human can expect to reach.</p><p>The Social and Ecological Destruction of Oil<br> Yesterday we were at Erema in Egi, Rivers State. Before then we had visited Ogoniland and seen the dastard pollution at Goi - a forgotten and totally deserted village. The people are groaning under severe oil pollution and loss of land. We shared ideas on environmental monitoring and protection, on the value of soils and the need to preserve our seeds and food systems. The interesting thing at Egi was that the cardinal request is that the Federal Government should enlist the help of the United Nations Environment Programme to conduct a forensic audit of their environment in a way similar to what was concluded on the environment of Ogoniland in 2011. They are not entrapped by current infrastructure politics. They simply want their soil back! We heard similar demands during the interactions at the Right Livelihood Lecture held at the University of Port Harcourt. Ken Saro-Wiwa was a fellow Right Livelihood Awardee (1994). We are here to pay tribute on the 20th anniversary of his execution, and to commit ourselves to continue the struggle for which he gave his life. We also the martyrdom of other Ogoni leaders who stood for justice and community rights.</p><p>The Egi people see their problem clearly as a human right issue. And they are right. The African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights declares that All Africans shall have a right to a safe and satisfactory environment in which to develop. The Egi people were quick to add that they want both the audit and clean-up of their environment to be undertaken expeditiously and not left to gather dusts on some shelves as has been the case of the Ogoni environmental assessment- four years after submission of the report.</p><p>The 2011 UNEP assessment of Ogoni environment showed incredible levels of pollution caused by the activities of Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) and the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC). The report highlights that in over 40 locations tested in Ogoniland, the soil is polluted with hydrocarbons up to a depth of 5 metres and that all the water bodies in Ogoni land are polluted. It also reported that in some places the water was polluted with benzene, a known carcinogen, at levels 900 above World Health Organisation standards. With life expectancy standing at about 41 years, the clean up of Ogoniland is projected to require a cumulative 30 years to clean both the land and water. Meanwhile weekends in Ogoniland are marked by carnivals of funerals of people in their 20s and 30s.</p><p>Soil, Water and Climate Wars<br> It has been estimated that with rising global warming and shrinking water resources violence may increase in Africa by 54 per cent by 2030. Lake Chad is a major example of what looms ahead. The lake has diminished in size to less than 5% of what it was by 1960. The lake shrunk from 22,772 square kilometres in size to 15,4000 square kilometres between 1966 and 1973. Satellite images showed that the size stood at 2,276 square kilometres by 1982 and at a mere 1,756 square kilometres by 1994. The presence of invasive species over about 50 per cent of what is left of the lake further compounds the problem. This has led to the displacement of farmers, fisher folks and pastoralists that depended on it for their livelihoods. Although soil degradation and the management of the river systems that recharge the lake may be a contributory factor to its shrinkage, it is estimated that climate change and extreme and extended droughts triggered by it contributes at least 50 per cent to the current deplorable situation. If this is so, then ecological degradation and climate change are factors in the diverse manifestation of insecurity in the area, including the scourge of Boko Haram as analysed in the Manifesto Terra Viva, Our Soil, Our commons, our future which we have collectively drafted. Care for the Earth is the best antidote to the rise of insecurity, violence and terrorism.</p><p>Food and Agriculture<br> It has been acknowledged that smallholder farmers hold the key to feeding the world. They also hold the key to cooling the planet because the agro-ecological food production enriches the soil rather than destroying it as industrial agriculture does. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has just issued an illuminating report Agroecology to Reverse Soil Degradation and Achieve Food Security that buttresses this fact. We cannot afford to be drawn into a system that promotes genetically engineered seeds and organisms, and chemical fertilisers that do not deliver on any of their promises but rather have yielded a harvest of pains, deprivation and deaths. While these costly inputs make super-profits for giant corporations, they destroy our soils, and trap our farmers in dependency and debt. With over 300,000 farmers suicides already recorded in India, the harmful nature of this agricultural model is without doubt.</p><p>The pressure on Africa to adopt uniform seed laws such as those promoted under African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO) is all aimed at seed colonization of Africa and must be resisted. The same goes with the promotion of GMOs through the weak Biosafety bills such as the one signed into law in Nigeria in the last week of the previous presidency. The unrelenting attack on our staple foods, including our cassava, cowpea (beans), corn and banana must be halted. The planting of genetically modified cotton in Burkina Faso was held up as a great success, yielding bumper harvests and enriching farmers. Recently Burkina Faso stopped planting Bt. Cotton. What example will they bring up next? Will Nigeria walk into that trap with her eyes open?</p><p>Soil, not oil is not a slogan but a statement of reality. Oil is a wasting resource and has wasted lives and now threatens the Planet. Oil economy is subject to political manipulation as we see with current price crash and the exposure of our countries to deep shocks. The oil economy is a negative economy on many levels. Our call today is that we must recover our sovereignty over our political structures, over our resources, over our food systems and over our lives. Soil, not oil. The soil is our life and our true wealth.</p>','We are living in a changing and challenging world. The change that has become our reality has not come about by accident.

While this is a sweet step towards total victory, we are saddened that while the case drags on the polluted lands are yet to be remediated and the victims are still deprived of the use of their lands and creeks.</span></p><p><span>Shell’s oil spills in the Niger Delta are well known and the oil company’s claims that such spills are caused by third party interferences often ring hollow, if you know the real story. The history of the spin by Shell that oil spills from their facilities are caused by third parties has been on since the 1980s. Although there was a spike in such interferences between 2005 and 2009 due to armed responses in the region, much of the spills are still attributable to equipment failure or poor maintenance.</span></p><p><span>In the particular set of cases filed in the court at The Hague in 2008, farmers from Ikot Ada Udo (Akwa Ibom State), Oruma (Bayelsa State) and Goi (Rivers State) all in the Niger Delta complained of devastating spills they suffered between 2004 and 2008. In Oruma it was an eruption from a pipeline buried to a depth of more than a metre underground. At Ikot Ada Udo it was capped well head that spewed crude oil into the air, land and waters for months before Shell stopped it. Goi is a special case. The community has neither an oil well nor a pipeline crossing its territory. What Goi has is a creek that is fed by an upstream river that brings crude oil spill from an oil facility. It also receives tidal flows from Bodo a bit downstream. The crude oil spill and resulting fire that sacked this community came from Shell’s spills from other communities.</span></p><p><span>It was therefore a surprise that the Court of first instance only found Shell culpable over the oil spill at Ikot Ada Udo and not for the ones at Oruma and Goi in its judgement of January 2013.</span></p><p><span>The farmers and Friends of the Earth Netherlands approached the court of appeal demanding an overturning of decisions that cleared Shell of responsibility. Shell also appealed against the verdict against them with regard to the case from Ikot Ada Udo. </span><span>The Dutch Court decided against Shell’s claim that the court is incompetent to rule on the activities of it’s subsidiary in Nigeria.</span></p><p><span>With the dismissal of Shell’s competence argument, the substantive case can now proceed in earnest and the question of Shell’s guilt over the damage of the farmers’ lands will now be taken on.</span></p><p><span>Geert Ritsema, head of campaign at Friends of the Earth Netherlands, also known as Milieudefensie, applauded the verdict as a big blow to Shell’s seven years old argument that the Dutch court cannot rule on the oil pollution in Nigeria. According to him, “these delaying tactics have now come to an end and Shell have to take responsibility for damage to the environment and the property of the Nigerian farmers.”</span></p><p><span>This is a very significant judgement. It cements the fact that a transnational corporation cannot avoid being held to account at home for their environmental crimes or misbehaviour in other countries.

The explosion and raging inferno occurred during a Joint Inspection Visit (JIV) embarked on to determine the cause of an ongoing oil spill there. The explosion and ensuing inferno claimed at least fourteen lives, including those of two government officials.</span><span>  </span><span>The tragedy was followed by contentious processes of identifying the victims and according them decent burial – a near impossible due to reported reticence of Agip and the fact that some of the victims were burnt to ashes.</span></p><p><span>In reaction to the Azuzuana tragedy, Iniruo Wills, the Commissioner for Environment in Bayelsa State said, “</span><em>It is time to declare a State of Emergency on the Environment in the Bayelsa State in particular and the Niger Delta in general, in order to save the lives of our people and the future of our communities. For the people of Bayelsa State and especially the families of the victims and staff of the Bayelsa State Ministry of Environment, July 2015 will go down as the July of death, on account of the needless deaths inflicted upon our beloved ones and colleagues by the Nigeria’s environmentally irresponsible oil and gas industry… We are grieving, but we must now also insist yet again that it is time to take decisive action to stop this perilous hazard that has become a routine threat to life and ecology in Bayelsa State and the Niger Delta.”</em></p><p><span>We recall that in 2000, a fire resulting from a faulty machine claimed the lives of eighteen youths that were assisting in repair works along the Agip’s Brass-Ogoda pipeline. On 29 July 2012 another fire erupted along the same company’s pipeline at Ayambele/Kalaba community. At this 2012 incident sixteen persons, including military personnel and community youths narrowly escaped death.</span></p><p><span>Haphazard treatment of oil spills has remained a worrisome trend in the oil fields of the Niger Delta. Forests and wetlands have been set on fire as oil companies and their contractors try to hide oil spills. In other instances, attempts have been made to cover up crude oil spills with imported soils or simply by turning the soil at the point of incident. These futile efforts have left horrific environmental scars across the oil field communities of the region.</span></p><p><span>Several oil spills have been reported by community field monitors. We will pick examples from the last six months.</span></p><p><span>A major spill occurred on Christmas Day at Agip’s Tebidaba Well 9 at Ikebiri. As the crude spewed into the fragile ecosystem the community was faced with the dilemma of either permitting the oil company to shut down the polluting well or to wait for a JIV before any shut down was permitted. However, shut down was effected to save the environment. The visit comprising officials from NOSDRA, Agip, security personnel, State Ministry of Environment and community representatives, was conducted on 27 December 2015 only to be declared as inconclusive, to the chagrin of the community. An earlier JIV following a spill that occurred at the same oil well in November 2014 was equally declared to be inconclusive and nothing has been heard of it ever since.</span></p><p><span>Community monitors are rapidly losing confidence in regulatory agencies over their handling of oil spill incidents.</span></p><p><span>“How do they expect us to have confidence in them if they cannot say the simple truth of what they saw? They are all bad and criminal-minded folks who ought to be neutral but fail to be so. I will never trust the regulators again; whether from NOSDRA, DPR or Ministry of Environment,” fumed a community leader at Ikebiri</span><strong>. </strong><span>Erosion of confidence in regulatory agencies is extremely dangerous in a highly polluted environment such as the Niger Delta. It should be noted that the equipment used for tests during the JIVs are often provided by the oil companies involved.</span></p><p><span>Shell notched some spills within the period, notably the ones at Odau community on 2 June 2015 and at Adibawa Well 8 on 12 July 2015. </span><span> </span><span>The spill at Odau, in Rivers State, spread to Oruma/Yibama community in Bayelsa State. The spilt crude went up in flames some months later, causing severe environmental damage in the Oruma/Yibama community. These incidents highlight the cross-border nature of environmental pollution and the consequences of environmental impunity.</span></p><p><span>A significant dimension was also highlighted by the multiple spills close to the Okordia Manifold at Ikarama community on 12 August 2015. Terror was unleashed on Ikarama community following that spill and some community members including the paramount ruler were arrested and detained. The arrests were peacefully protested by Ikarama women. Disagreement over surveillance contact arrangement between Shell and community youths was fingered in the incidents and resultant conflict.</span></p><p><span>Another Agip spill was noticed by community monitors when they saw spreading crude in the creeks of Emago-Kugbo on 12 July 2015. The spill site was reportedly set ablaze on 25 July. A community a farmer, Dumani Lucky, was burned and choked to death as he attempted to boat through the polluted area to his farm.</span></p><p><span>A monitor captured the situation this way, “The fire also burned the barge, tug boat and other equipment mobilized for the clamping by Agip or company contractor. In fact, the tug boat sank and is now only serving as an anchor to the barge. After they set the spill site ablaze the whole community environment was as dark as if there was no sun. People had to stay indoors to avoid the smoke. Visibility only improved from midday. Later that day we had a heavy rainfall and the entire community was flooded with dark water. We don’t know what to do because Agip has been treating us badly for so long a time.”</span></p><p><span>Death, ecological destruction and inconclusive JIVs portend more harm to the Niger Delta environment. With the delay in proposed clean-up of the Ogoni environment, no seriousness to halt gas flaring and with the continued piling of more pollution, we have to construct a new ecological consciousness on the part of citizens. This consciousness must necessarily include tough resistance to so-called inconclusive JIVs – a not so clever way of blaming the victims and claiming that oil spills are caused by third party interferences rather than putrid pipelines and ill-maintained equipment. The new consciousness should include constant monitoring and reporting and insistence on urgent clean-ups and strict liability on the part of polluters.</span></p><p><span>We intended to share a Happy New Year greeting, but we are concerned about the survival of our environment and peoples.

To use the words of Joseph Croft of Stakeholder Democracy Network (SDN) in the excellent environmental documentary film <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W1JrTwGX8U\">No Where to Run</a>, the gas flares are like giant cigarettes attached to communities. Some flares are located horizontally, at ground level, posing even greater dangers to the communities. There are several examples, including at Oben, Edo State and Kolo Creek in Bayelsa State.</p><p>Communities with gas flare stacks are sentenced to live with these furnaces and cannot avoid the heat, the noise, the poisons and the offensive vista. It is estimated that flared gas could potentially generate over 25,000 GWh of electricity which would meet a high proportion of Nigeria’s most ambitious power projections.</p><p>The Associated Gas Reinjection Act of 1979 outlawed gas flaring in Nigeria with effect from January 1984 and was aimed at compelling oil companies producing oil and gas in Nigeria to submit preliminary programs for gas re-injection as well as detailed plans for implementation. Oil companies can only flare, as an interim measure, if they have site-specific certificates permitting them to flare. Permitted or not, companies are required to pay fines for lighting those giant cigarettes in our communities. Unfortunately, routine gas flaring continues.</p><p>The penalty for gas flaring remains low and does not offer real incentives to defaulting oil companies to stop the practice. The current penalty for gas flaring in Nigeria was set by a Ministerial directive issued on 15 August 2011 at $3.50 per 1000 standard cubic feet. Attempts by the National Assembly, including through the moribund Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), to raise the penalty to equal the commercial price of natural gas has not seen the light of day.</p><p>About $1.1bn gas flare penalties are reportedly not collected annually. This is more than the amount required to commence the full implementation of the UNEP report on the clean up of Ogoni environment. It simply goes up in smoke annually by way of uncollected fines from gas flaring. This sum could also assist in plugging the deficit in the 2016 National Budget if the reneged oil companies are compelled to pay up.</p><p>The Nigerian Gas Flare Tracker website informs that, according to a report issued in 2012 by the Petroleum Revenue Special Task Force, oil companies often do not pay the fines “and when they do are still paying the old penalty of N10 per 1000 standard cubic feet flared.”</p><p>The Task Force reported that the Department of Petroleum Resources, DPR, was “unable to independently track and measure gas volumes produced and flared. It depends largely on the information provided by the operators. There were no available records or information in respect of gas flare volumes for the years 2005 and 2011.” There are no readily available records for fines paid for gas flared in the period 2012-2015.</p><p>The loss of revenue to Nigeria from non-compliance to the 2011 penalty regime is enormous. According to the report of the task force, “Using the DPR gas flare information (irrespective of the inherent errors…) to compute the potential revenues for the relevant years at the rate of $3.50 per scf is $4.1billion versus the $177million computed by the DPR using the N10 per scf.”</p><p>The <a href=\"http://gasflaretracker.ng/about.html\">Nigerian Gas Flare Tracker</a> hosted by the Federal Ministry of Environment is a tool that every Nigerian should look up to be informed about the atrocious gas flaring going on at about 220 locations across the Niger Delta. It is a great tool for public information.

In the Paris suburb of Montreuil, La Vía Campesina’s Paula Gioia said that <em>“System change will not come from inside Le Bourget. We small-scale farmers, land workers and migrants, indigenous people, rural women and rural youth have to do it ourselves. We do this with peasant agroecology and food sovereignty.”</em></p><p>For La Via Campesina (LVC), system change entails ecological production under popular democratic control. Small-scale farmer agriculture is essential to averting climate crisis, according to GRAIN, an international non-governmental organization (NGO) and ally of LVC. The industrial food system contributes some fifty percent of total global greenhouse gas emissions.[iii] In contrast, the peasants and small-scale farmers who make up ninety percent of the world’s farmers, produce more food with less fossil energy and waste, with more soil carbon sequestration capacity, and they do so on a quarter of the world’s farmland.[iv]</p><p>The importance of social movement activism and the need for global system change are confirmed by  overwhelming focus governments place on corporate market-based solutions which have been demonstrated to fail.[v]  Pat Mooney, long-time NFU member and Right Livelihood Award winner, rejected claims that the Paris agreement was a success:</p><p><em>“I feel like we are being asked to put our children, and in my case, my grandchildren on a bus. The governments are saying that you can trust this bus, they will take your kids home. And yet, the bus has to cross a river, and the river does not have a bridge. The governments are saying … there will be a bridge that will get us across, which will be biomass energy carbon capture and storeage [(BECCS)] technologies that do not exist at this moment.  ... But worse than that, the bus that we just put our kids on has no brakes. There are no controls to greenhouse gas emissions, it’s just voluntary. So I cannot think of anything worse.  … What we have is something much worse than Copenhagen … because people believe that governments have achieved something here and they have not. It is much worse than Kyoto purported to be. [Since 1992], we have had twenty-three years of lies and dishonesty, and they have made it into a party.”<strong>[vi]</strong></em></p><p><strong>2. Movement Convergences</strong></p><p>Movements are building links so that the disparate struggles converge into a unified drive to make the transition to a new system.  This convergence acknowledges the need to go beyond solidarity and to act jointly “as one struggle”. La Vía Campesina is playing a crucial role in strengthening the connections among movements fighting for global system change.</p><p>La Vía Campesina delegates to the Paris climate talks worked tirelessly to emphazise that “Food Sovereignty – based on peasant agroecology, traditional knowledge, selecting, saving and sharing local adoptive seeds, and control over our lands, biodiversity, waters, and territories – is a true, viable, and just solution to a global climate crisis caused largely by transnational corporations.”[vii] Food sovereignty and agroecology are required if we are going to keep eighty percent of fossil fuels in the ground, as science and justice demand. This central fact makes the timely convergence of food and energy struggles all the more crucial.</p><p>In addition to making food and energy connections, LVC also pledged stronger identification with refugee and anti-racist struggles. In defiance of the French government’s ban on protests, on December 9th LVC delegates joined an international solidarity rally against racism, xenophobia and the criminalization of migration which was organized by frontline and indigenous communities from France, USA and Canada. The action was held outside a refugee detention center on the outskirts of Paris in an effort to connect directly with the people inside the center who would hear our voices and our speeches on the loud microphone. I spoke at this rally on behalf of LVC, denouncing theft of peasant land and seeds. I denounced the pollution of water and the climate change that forces farmers to leave their homes to seek safety from conflict and violence.</p><p>It was apparent in Paris that movements are acting on a new understanding that the struggle against climate change is intersectional. There is widespread recognition that social and ecological crises are rooted in the same system that puts profits before life; a system of domination and exploitation of nature, including people. This understanding has become a mainstream consensus. Because climate justice is not a single-issue struggle, it is crucial that the growing forces focused on climate disaster connect to what others are doing right across the progressive panorama of movements, and then act collectively.</p><p><strong>3. Women on the Frontlines</strong></p><p>In Paris it was evident that movement activists of every stripe acknowledged that specific women, especially women from indigenous communities, women of colour and women from the global south, are at the forefront of the struggle for system change. Women of colour are the most exploited and threatened by capitalism, yet they have immense power. This power is rooted in the daily cooperation and the solar commoning political economy within which specific women have profound experience and significant control. Solar commoning — collective control over the means of life, relying on ecological agriculture and solar, not fossil, energy — is a name for the post-fossil-capitalist new society.  Because it now exists in embryo and has ancient roots it can be quickly scaled up and generalized to preserve life itself.</p><p>In Paris I heard dozens of women point out that the struggle against climate change is a struggle against all manner of violations of life, especially territory enclosure, extreme extractivism such as fracking, the genetic modification of plants, synthetic biology, the imposition of mega dams and industrial animal production. According to Sophie Huot from Kenya,</p><p><em>“Women know very well that if you destroy Mother Nature then we are all destroyed. And so women are taking charge. We have the solutions because it is women who deal with land, … [and] the water. … Indigenous women, grassroots women … are not relenting”.</em></p><p>Movements are not seeking ‘green’ capitalist reform but rather the break-up of the racialized, gendered class hierarchy that produces ecocide. These are movements that prioritize the struggles of frontline women.</p><p>Paris 2015 brought an unprecedented new moment in social evolution onto the world stage. Movements are making the transition to a post-fossil capitalist epoch, especially within the food system but also in nearly every other sector, and affirming life in all its dimensions.</p><p> ·<em>Terran Giacomini is an Associate Member of the National Farmers Union (NFU) of Canada</em></p><p><em><em>Photo by: Salena Tramel</em></em></p><p>Notes </p><p>[i]           Anderson, K. 2012.

One is about designing and fabrication of a refinery at a Nigerian university and the second one is about new dates for ending gas flaring in Nigeria.</span></p><p><span>First is the news that the Department of Chemical engineering at the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria has <a href=\"http://www.ngrguardiannews.com/2016/01/hope-rises-as-zaria-varsity-builds-mini-refinery-develops-zeolite/\">built a mini refinery</a> that can “produce relatively small quantity of petroleum products.” The relatively small quantity this prototype handles is given as one barrel of crude oil per day. This information was shared at a press briefing on the 38th convocation of the university.</span></p><p><span><strong>Biafra Refined Crude</strong></span></p><p><span>It would be interesting to place this <em>breakthrough</em> alongside the bush refineries in the Niger Delta that have been in the business of refining crude oil and supplying a variety of products to consumers in the region. We do not have details of the mini-refinery built at ABU. It would be good to know if any engineering departments in our universities have done studies of the bush refineries to see how the technologies adopted in the illegal operations could be adopted, upgraded and used to meet the energy gaps of the nation. So far the engagement with bush refineries has been by the Joint Military Task Force (JTF) and their methodology has been to <a href=\"http://icirnigeria.org/burning-of-bush-refineries-threaten-environment-in-niger-delta/\">bomb or burn</a> the refineries. </span></p><p><span>The fabrication of a mini crude oil refinery at the ABU would be significant or novel if the technology is different from what has been in operation in the world for over one hundred years. Just as anyone can ferment fruits (and grains) to obtain alcohol from them, the folks in the creeks and the scientists in then Biafra had the means of refining crude that could be studied and improved on.  A commentator writing in <a href=\"http://saharareporters.com/2009/07/20/biafra-could-refine-fuel-nigeria-can’t\">Sahara Reporters</a> once said, “The most damning of Nigerian failures for now is the knowledge that while the defunct Biafra Republic could refine fuel some forty years ago the triumphant old country cannot refine enough fuel for its local consumption today. It’s a shame that cries to the high heavens.”</span></p><p><span>One recollects how some years ago a dispute broke out between scientists at a Nigerian university over who among them was the first to extract alcohol from pineapple and some other local fruits. The point is that the entire dispute was nothing more than a bad joke. Hopefully, this news about refining crude is not.</span></p><p><span><strong>To Flare or Not to Flare</strong></span></p><p><span>The second item should raise our antenna is about when the ongoing routine flaring of associated gas would end in Nigeria.  For a period of time, successive governments kept shifting the deadline for ending gas flaring from year to year. During the almost one decade of debates on the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) nothing was said about when gas flaring would end. A specific bill on gas flaring died without a whimper. The flames roared on while governments stayed mute. </span></p><p><span>The “new” Petroleum Industry Governance &amp; Institutional Framework Bill (PIG-IFB or PI(GIF)B?) that is in the works is totally silent about when gas flaring would end, and is <strong>not concerned with communities or environmental issues.</strong> It even makes a passing reference to fracking as one of the things that occurs in the upstream sector of the petroleum industry signifying that the oil industry in Nigeria may be getting set to embark on fracking, an extreme form of extraction. Is the new Bill attempting to sidestep the concerns of suffering communities that the old PIB tried to address and how many PIBs should we expect from the present administration?</span></p><p><span>Okay, we are now told that <a href=\"http://sweetcrudereports.com/2016/01/22/gas-flaring-in-nigeria-to-end-by-2020-govt/\">gas flaring would end between 2018 and 2020</a>. This was disclosed by the Group General Manager, Nigerian Petroleum Investment and Management Services (NAPIMS), Dafe Sajebor and the Managing Director of National Petroleum Development Corporation (NPDC), Sadler Mai-Bornu at a meeting with the Senate panel investigating the activities of oil and gas agencies in the country. A bit of news from the blue!</span></p><p><span>The World Bank plans to see zero routine gas flaring by 2030 and governments that endorse this initiative are expected to provide legal, regulatory, investment, and operating environment that is conducive to upstream business while ensuring that non-flaring of associated gas is in-built in all production plans. It is curious that the proposed PIG-IFB or PI(GIF)B does not say anything about halting routine gas flaring or even about the penalty for the heinous offence.</span></p><p><span>Obviously more information needs to be placed in the public realm on how the government plans to achieve zero routine gas flaring by 2018-2020. What plans do oil companies like Chevron, Shell, Total and ExxonMobil have to stop the routine flaring of associated gas in the Niger Delta? The biggest gas flaring company in Nigeria is Chevron. Nigeria and Chevron are not among the 45 countries and companies that endorsed the <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/zero-routine-flaring-by-2030#4\">World Bank plan</a> going by the list on the bank’s website. Neither is climate denier ExxonMobil on that roster. Angola, Cameroon, Republic of Congo and Gabon are the only African countries to have endorsed the plan.</span></p><p><span>If the big polluters are staying off commitment to end gas flaring even by 2030, what should we say is the basis for oilfield communities to hope that they would soon be able to breath fresh air once again?</span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>    </span></p><p><span> </span></p>','','article',1453900574,1453900574),(127,'Action Research Network for a Wellbeing Economy in Africa ','<p><span><span><strong>WE-Africa</strong> is </span>an alliance of scholars and practitioners<span> working to promote a transition to a wellbeing-based economy for Africa.</span></span><span><br></span></p>','','url_link',1453906466,1453977233),(128,'Earthy Tales','<p>Nnimmo&#39;s blog on environmental and social issues</p>','','url_link',1454270040,1454270040),(129,'A Living Memorial for Deadened Memories','<p><span>The Bus, a sculptural memorial in honour of Ken Saro-Wiwa, </span><span>Saturday Dobee, Nordu Eawo, Daniel Gbooko, Paul Levera, Felix Nuate, Baribor Bera, Barinem Kiobel, and John Kpuine</span><span> was shipped to Nigeria from the United Kingdom by Platform.

Instead it was the naked fist of raw power versus the vociferous protestations of a disenfranchised minority writhing beneath the weight of a seemingly implacable military dictatorship. </span></p><p><span>“Ken Saro-Wiwa became the voice, face and symbol of this aggrieved minority straining for denied civic and democratic rights. He became a hero in patently unheroic times and this is what makes his life and the loss of it so potently poignant.” </span></p><p><span>It is for this and other reasons that 10th November has galvanized a global environmental justice movement and has become a global day of remembrance of victims of extractivism.

Neither are highways or super highways, as the people of Ekuri Community are learning. <a href=\"http://wrm.org.uy/articles-from-the-wrm-bulletin/section1/nigiera-a-unique-example-of-community-based-forest-management-at-the-ekuri-community/\">The Ekuri Community Forest</a> in Cross River State, Nigeria, is an acclaimed example of how communities can sustainably manage their forest. Now, this forest is under threat from the State Government that has embarked on the construction of a 260 Km, 6 lanes dual carriage super highway through their forest, using the highly controversial Land Use Act of 1979 as a cover for dispossessing the people of their land, forest and patrimony.</p><p>When the ground breaking ceremony for this project was conducted by President Muhammadu Buhari on 30th October 2015, the Ekuri Community thought that having an all-weather road pass by their community would bring to an end their perpetual struggle to secure access to the outside world through the earth road they had built by community effort. This thinking was shattered by a <strong>Public Notice of Revocation</strong> signed by the Commissioner for Lands and Urban Development and published in a local newspaper on 22nd January 2016 decreeing, among other things, that:</p><p> “all rights of occupancy existing or deemed to exist on all that piece of land or parcel of land lying and situate along the Super Highway from Esighi, Bakassi Local Government Government Area to Bekwarra Local Government Area of Cross River State covering a distance of 260km approximately and having an offset of 200m on either side of the centre line of the road and further 10km after the span of the Super Highway, excluding Government Reserves and public institutions are hereby revoked for overriding public purpose absolutely”.</p><p><strong>Land Grabbing</strong></p><p>The community studied the “Notice of Revocation” and the line profile and found that some of the coordinates show that their forest, community lands and settlements would be taken up by the Super Highway and the extraordinary right of way of 10 Km claimed by the government - beyond the 200 metres right of way allowed from the centre line on each side of the road. Little wonder the community characterises this usurpation as a case of crass land land grabbing. This sort of grabbing tends to suggest that this part of Nigeria is <em>Tarzan</em> country or simply a no-man’s land.</p><p> </p><p>Before this, some critics of the Super Highway project such as the Rainforest Resource Development Centre (RRDC) had stated that “the BLUE PRINTS of such a huge 260km 6 lanes Super Highway project running across the entire Cross River State of Nigeria was not made public before the commencement of construction at the ground breaking event.  Significantly also, the blue print of the said project has not been made public till this moment.  This is a contravention of the <strong>Freedom of Information Act, 2011</strong> of the National Assembly as well as other related legislations…”</p><p> </p><p>Other significant issues raised include the fact that no credible Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) have been conducted before the taking off of the project. The project threatens the Cross River National Park as the highway traverses the buffer zone of the forest. </p><p> </p><p>In its <a href=\"http://www.environewsnigeria.com/buhari-demand-answers-questions-super-highway-project/\">press briefing</a> of 6th November 2015, the RRDC expressed the fear that contrary to the requirement of the Land Use Act, no schedules of compensation (including the names of beneficiaries) had been made public.  “The risk is that this project could end up escalating rural poverty if the issues of compensations are neglected.  This is so because the affected indigenous people and communities of Cross River State of Nigeria who own these resources could end up losing their sources of livelihoods, income and wellbeing, as well as their natural heritage and territories.”</p><p> </p><p><strong>Heritage Destruction</strong></p><p>What RDDC feared is unfolding before the eyes of the Ekuri people and the world must not keep a blind eye to this.</p><p> </p><p>The Ekuri Community through a petition, dated 6th February 2016, reminded the Cross River State government that they had “for centuries conserved and managed our Ekuri community forest for its rich biodiversity and ecosystems services not only for our sustainable development but for the entire world. Since 1992, we pioneered formal community forestry in Nigeria and established the Ekuri Initiative (an NGO registered with the Federal Government) with a mandate in forest conservation, sustainable forest management, community development and poverty reduction. Since its inception, we have recorded inspiring successes. We have developed and implemented a land use plan which we jealously adhere to, a flagship community forestry project in Nigeria (a credit to Cross River State), the largest and best community managed forest in West Africa totaling 33,600ha. We received the UNEP <a href=\"http://equatorinitiative.org/index.php?option=com_winners&amp;view=winner_detail&amp;id=66&amp;Itemid=683&amp;lang=en\">Equator Award in 2004</a> for our outstanding passion, commitments and efforts to reducing poverty through the conservation and sustainable use of our biodiversity. We have been visited by several communities from Nigeria, Cameroon, Kenya, Uganda and Mozambique and a host of researchers to learn from our experiences. Our activities have been replicated by international development agencies and local NGOs and has brought fame to Cross River State and Nigeria as a whole. The planned destruction of our community forests which we have labored so hard to protect and conserve is not a welcome development. The resolve of our forebears to conserve our forest must be continued in perpetuity being a bequest and legacy to all the Ekuri people living and yet unborn.”</p><p> </p><p><strong>Dialogue with Bulldozers</strong></p><p>With the level of dispossession staring them in the face, the Ekuri Community decided to reject the passage of the Super Highway through their forest and demand a realignment of the road. According to community sources, their petition received a quick but shocking response:</p><p> </p><p>“At the receipt of the Protest Letter, the Governor has quickly sent a bulldozer this morning to Ekuri to begin the destruction of the Ekuri community forest in the name of the Super Highway. This is to show power and strength against poor communities and in defiance of the dictates of the rule of law.” </p><p> </p><p>If the world keeps quiet and allows the bulldozers to have their way, they would not only bulldoze the future of the Ekuri people, the act would entrench impunity, satisfy the lust for capital, promote deforestation in one of the last remaining pristine forest in Africa and blunt our collective hope for tackling global warming. This is a challenge, not just for Ekuri Community but for the entire global community.</p><p> </p><p>    </p><p> </p>','','article',1455487408,1455487408),(132,'HOMEF Annual Report 2014','','','publication',1455541362,1455541362),(134,'Foundation develops Environmental Monitoring Guide for extractive industry communities','','','article',1455625703,1455625751),(135,'They Don\'t Care if We Exist','<p>14th February was celebrated as Lover’s day across the world, but in parts of the creeks of the Niger Delta it turned out to be a tragic day. While lovers dressed with a <em>touch of red</em>, Forcados communities were braced for the unknown with the threat of having their water ways coated with crude oil rose by the hour. On that day, Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC or Shell) announced that there was an oil spill from their 1.2 metres (48 inches) export line and that they were investigating the cause. The point of leak lies under 4.5 metres of water.</p><p>To be sure that the right thing was done, that the environment was protected and that communities were not left in limbo, the Minister of Environment, Amina Mohammed and the Minister of State for Environment, Ibrahim Usman Jibril, visited the Forcados Terminal to see things for themselves. They forsook the luxury of getting there on a chopper and took to the boats to get there through the choppy, and at times, treacherous waves. Their move sent a strong signal that the business of ecological defence in these parts was taking a necessary curve.</p><p>We should also say here that since taking office, these ministers have toured the environmental crisis hotspots in Nigeria – including those polluted by oil and industrial activities, those impacted by desertification and loss of wetlands and those facing the menace of gully erosion. They have also been in constant consultations to ensure that the implementation of the UNEP report on Ogoni environment is not only implemented but that other parts of the Niger Delta would not be left on the lurch.</p><p> </p><p>The trip to Forcados was all business. Forcados in Burutu Local Government Area of Delta State, Nigeria hosts the second oil export terminal in Nigeria besides the one at Bonny in Rivers State. There was no media announcement and no paparazzi. Government officials on the visit were John Nani - the Commissioner for Environment, Delta State and Dan Yingi - Chairman of the Environment Committee of the Delta State House of Assembly The other officials were Mrs Akutu -the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry  and  Idris Musa of the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA). And then there were three of us from the environmental justice constituency: Emem Okon, Monday Itoghor and yours truly.</p><p>Arrival at Forcados Terminal was an hour’s bounce on the waves in a convoy of military boats. On the way we passed solitary boats with stoic fisher women and men hoping for a catch, and obviously at home with the boisterous waves around them.</p><p>On arrival at the Terminal, the visiting team was given a presentation on the incident by Shell officials. Before zeroing in on the incident, they went on a history tour of developments on the Terminal as well as on past incidents.</p><p><strong>Spills remembered</strong></p><p>The terminal commenced operations 1971, that is 45 years ago and had a major upgrade in 1998.</p><p>Shell noted that the incident of 14th February 2016 was almost on the 10th anniversary of an 18th February 2006 militant attack on the pipeline. They also mentioned an attack on their 36 inches produced water pipelines in 2006. Produced water is dumped into the creeks and rivers of the Niger Delta after treatment by the production companies.</p><p> </p><p>The company provides constant electricity from gas turbines to the two major communities in Forcados, Ogulagha and Odimodi. Shell has 36 power generating turbines here and only needs 2 to power their operations at the Terminal. Since the shutdown power is supplied from diesel run electricity generators. This may soon be rationed as supply runs low.</p><p> </p><p>Shell also informed that on 4th March 2014 there was a third party interference on their export line at a depth of 8 metres and that this was a through a <strong>sophisticated theft point that only professionals</strong> could have done.</p><p> </p><p>The current spill happened 5km off the coast and led to a shut in of 300,000 barrels a day of crude oil from government owned Shell, Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) and a Nigerian company, Seplat Petroleum Development Company. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Chronology of a Spill and Response</strong></p><p>The loading of a vessel, MT Yamuna Spirit, commenced from 10:00 am on 12th February 2016. Loading was suspended at 0:20 am on 14th February when the spill was noticed. Seplat and NPDC were informed to stop pumping crude oil to the Terminal at 5:41 pm on 14th February.</p><p> </p><p>Shell deployed booms at 9:35 am on 15th February to curtail the spread of the crude and a specialised surveillance aircraft arrived from Ghana at 10:30 am on 17th February to join the effort. By the time of the visit, they had deployed 27 skimmers and plastic tanks for collection of recovered crude. They also stated that community people were recruited to join the clean up effort.</p><p> </p><p>When the Minister asked what actions had been taken to protect and assist the impacted communities, Shell officials informed that so far they had recovered 25 barrels of crude and had mobilised relief materials such as rice, beans, vegetable oil and water to the major communities.</p><p> </p><p>Tellingly, Shell would not disclose how many barrels of crude oil has been dumped into the sea, creeks and the lands from this incident.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Cause of Incident</strong></p><p>Although investigations by the Joint Inspection Team –made up of company and government officials, as well as community representatives- have not been concluded, Shell insisted that the spill was caused by a third party interference. How are they so sure of this? They displayed thick concrete pieces collected from the sea bed at the point of leakage. The pipe is protected by being encased in concrete reinforced with wire mesh. The second point that they claimed provided irrefutable proof was that some communities people informed them that they heard a big bang at a time that coincided with when the spill occurred.</p><p> </p><p>On being questioned by the Minister of Environment, they agreed that they would have to wait for the conclusion of the investigations and further expert examination, before drawing any conclusions about the cause of the spill.</p><p> </p><p>My note here was that even if the exact time of the rupture of the pipe was known, hearing a loud notice from the community could not rigidly prove that a third party interference had occurred on the pipeline at a point 5 km out at sea. That sounds like one “hearsay” taken too far!</p><p> </p><p>The Minister of Environment appreciated the fact that Shell notified her ministry of the spill on 15th February. She told them that President Buhari is determined to ensure a clean up of Ogoniland as well as the entire Niger Delta. She noted that whether the present incident was caused by equipment failure or by third party action, the government was concerned that the communities, the environment and the economy should not suffer.</p><p> </p><p><strong>They Don’t Care if We Exist</strong></p><p><strong><img src=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/U0J83VCv/wp_20160219_048_dvd.mp4\" alt=\"Community chat with Minister\"></strong></p><p>After the Official presentation it was time to visit some of the impacted communities. We headed towards the open sea, but after about 15 minutes in choppy waves and heavy salt water sprays, it was obvious that it was not the right time to proceed in that direction using the boats we had. So back to the Terminal we returned. From here we went to Oseigbene  village (also called Okutu) right at the edge of the Terminal to see things for ourselves.</p><p> </p><p>Shell had tried to say that the spill was being contained and kept from hitting the shoreline, but the visit to this village showed very extensive crude oil pollution of the community, especially their creek, the major source of potable water. There were booms and skimmers deployed by Shell here, but these were clearly rudimentary and ineffective. The crude oil simply coursed beyond the feeble booms while the skimmers whirled and skimmed what they could.</p><p> </p><p>The mangrove forests were heavily impacted. Dead crabs and fish littered the shoreline at the village. It was a river of oil as far as we could see. The effort to put up a clean-up show for the visiting Minister did not quite pan out as they may have expected.</p><p> </p><p>Community women spoke up. The told the Minister that Shell does not appear to care whether they existed or not. That no one cared if they were humans. They had no road, no electricity and no water. They had no jobs and were not engaged in the clean up processes. They had also not received any relief materials. Their children were sick as a result of the spill and some were in hospitals receiving treatment. After the visit the oil company officials said they were not aware of any illnesses arising from the spill.</p><p> </p><p>The Minister assured the community that her visit was to ensure that their situation was handled properly and that their environment would be cleaned up. She also noted that the women and children bore special impacts from incidents like the present one and that something would be done to assist them.</p><p> </p><p>A short helicopter overflight of the spill point showed efforts being made to curtail the spread of the spill. Again the booms deployed out there did not appear to far any better than the ones seen at Oseigbene.</p><p> </p><p>This is the story of oil and the Niger Delta.</p><p> </p>','Shell had tried to say that the spill was being contained and kept from hitting the shoreline, but the visit to this village showed very extensive crude oil pollution of the community, especially their creek, the major source of potable water.

There they will engage in civil disobedience to stop the digging in one of Europe’s biggest open-pit lignite mines, which the Swedish company Vattenfall has put up for sale. The action will show any future buyer that all coal development will face resistance, and demonstrate the movement’s commitment to a different kind of energy system that prioritizes people and the planet over corporate power and profit. </span></div><p> </p><div><span>Nigeria</span><span>: In the Niger Delta actions will be held in 3 iconic locations that epitomise the decades old despoiling of the region. The actions will show clearly that Nigeria, nay Africa, is better off without the polluting activities of the fossil industry. They will also underscore the fact that people&#39;s action remains the viable way to save the planet from mankind&#39;s addiction to fossil fuels.</span></div><p> </p><div><span>Turkey</span><span>: community leaders in the Izmir region will confront the illegal tactics behind the coal industry’s plan to build dirty coal plants near their homes, in addition to those already operating illegally. They will gather at the gates of a massive, growing spoils mountain used by nearby coal plants against a court order to dispose of dangerous waste from the burning of coal. This action will unite several fights against individual coal plants into a unified stance against the current Turkish government’s plan to dramatically expand the use of coal in the country. </span></div><p> </p><div><span>Australia</span><span>: As an election approaches, climate activists will bring the country’s growing climate movement to the world’s largest coal port in Newcastle, and demonstrate their resolve to both make the climate a key issue in the coming election, and their determination to continue resisting coal no matter who is in the Prime Minister’s chair. </span></div><p> </p><div><span>Brazil</span><span>: Indigenous people and climate activists will join hands for four different peaceful actions addressing key parts of the country’s oil and gas infrastructure -- from where the gas is fracked in Indigenous land, to its risky transportation, to where it is burned. The exact details are being kept confidential, but thousands of participants are expected across more than a week of action in all areas of the country. </span></div><p> </p><div><span>United States</span><span>: Activists are targeting 6 key areas of fossil fuel development: new tar sands pipelines in the Midwest with an action near Chicago; fracking in the Mountain West with an event outside Denver; ‘bomb trains’ carrying fracked oil and gas to a port in Albany, NY; Shell’s devastating refinery pollution north of Seattle; action around offshore drilling in the Arctic, Atlantic, and Gulf coasts taking place in Washington, DC; and dangerous oil and gas drilling in Los Angeles.

However, the entire focus is on business and there is scant attention to the environment or the people. These may remain the milk cows that should simply steel themselves for more squeezes.</span></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><span>It is thought that the PIB will come in four parts arranged as follows:</span></p><p> </p><p> </p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst\"><strong><span><span>1.<span>     </span></span></span></strong><strong><span>The Governance and Institutional Framework for Oil and Gas</span></strong><strong><span> Bill</span></strong></p><p> </p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\"><strong><span><span>2.<span>     </span></span></span></strong><strong><span>The <span>Fiscal Reform</span> Bill</span></strong></p><p> </p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\"><span><span>3.<span>     </span></span></span><strong><span>Licencing Rounds Bill</span></strong></p><p> </p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpLast\"><strong><span><span>4.<span>     </span></span></span></strong><strong><span>Revenue Allocation and Management</span></strong><strong><span> Bill</span></strong></p><p> </p><p><span>It is expected that the fourth bill may say something about the funds for communities. Perhaps the logic is to serve the “controversial” consideration of oil field communities last with the hope that the hurdle will never be reached within the life of this government or that the controversy would have died of its own accord by such a time. </span></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><span>One complaint against the former PIB was that it was rather voluminous. Having the bill split into four volumes may make reading easier for text-message or SMS generation. </span></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><span>It could also be one way of displaying a bent towards <em>unbundling</em> the sector in all ramifications. Another plausible explanation could be that the sector is simply copying the industry’s <em>best practice </em>in other countries.</span></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong><span>Host Communities Conundrum</span></strong></p><p> </p><p><span>The sore point of the petroleum sector in Nigeria as in elsewhere is the serious impact it has on the environment, the communities and the people.</span></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><span>The fact that our politicians could not agree on any allocation of resources for host communities should not make the current legal draughtsmen push consideration to back burners. The President doubles as the Minister of Petroleum Resources and he should clarify what the intentions are with regard to the communities and indeed the oil field environment. With the clean up of Ogoni and the Niger Delta about to commence, informing about the global environmental architecture would help.</span></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><span>A key point is to ensure that host communities are not defined as only the communities that host oil wells, pipelines, flow stations, waste pits and other oil industry appurtenances. Here is the reason why this definition must be broadened. There are communities that do not have the physical presence of oil operations but are heavily impacted by those operations. A case in point is <a href=\"http://ogoninewsng.com/2014/09/28/agony-of-oil-spill-in-goi-community-ogoniland/\">Goi community</a> in Ogoni. This community has been severely impacted by repeated oil spills and related fires and one section of the community has been deserted for over a decade now. Yet, Goi has no pipeline and no oil well. It simply sits on the bank of a creek that connects oil facilities that have spewed crude and devastated their environment. Would it be right to say that Goi is not a host community? My point is that any community that has the potential to be impacted by petroleum sector accidents has to be classified as a host community. So, a host community is a community that hosts oil or industrial facilities as well as those that host pollutions.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Another case in point is that <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/23/opinion/holleman-exxon-valdez-anniversary/\">Exxon Valdez oil spill</a> of 1989 in Alaska. The spill so much impacted Prince William Sound and the coastline that, despite all clean up efforts, 27 years after effect is still there and less than half of the wild life population is yet to recover. </span></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong><span>Time to Come Clean</span></strong></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><span>It is time for the National Assembly and the Ministry of Petroleum Resource to come clean over the PIB. The draft bill(s) should be posted online and made available to citizens. It would help the ministry, the National Assembly and the nation if citizens are able to scrutinise the bill(s) and make comments based on knowledge rather on rumours. What are the provisions in the PIB for ending gas flaring? What is in it for the communities? Certainly the oil business cannot be allowed to be all about money to the detriment of life.</span></p><p> </p>','The current outcry over the non-inclusion in the new Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) of the Host Communities Fund that was provided for in the “old PIB” is justifiable.

There, key world leaders duly affirmed that the only way to save our globe from an obvious incineration would be to drastically cut the level of greenhouse emissions- from the current path of 4 degrees Celsius to a more manageable (but equally devastating) 2 degrees Celsius and below. </span></p><p><span><span> </span>However, they failed to make any strong commitments in relation to the specifics of what needs to be done to achieve the target. Indeed, the deal which came out of Paris merely recognizes all the problems associated with greenhouse emissions, recognizes all that needs to be done, but fails to spell the appropriate steps to be taken in order to address them. The reason for this reality is evident. The big national and multinational companies who control the global fossil fuel industry- be it crude oil, natural gas or coal - also have strong stakes and influence in global politics. Reducing greenhouse emissions means drastically reducing the level of extraction which results in reduced revenues. </span></p><p><span>So weak and fearful of corporate power was the entire Paris climate deal that it only spoke about the need to reduce greenhouse emissions in abstract, without mentioning the need to cut the extraction of fossils which is what eventually leads to emissions. The truth is that when fossils are extracted, one way or the other, sooner or later, it gets burnt. Rather than speak of reducing emissions, the Paris deal might have done better if it concentrated on reducing extraction of fossils. </span></p><p><span>Elaborating further on this reality, Surveyor Efik, National Coordinator of Climate Change Network Nigeria and member of the Climate Action Network International says, <em>“the global commitment to drastically reduce emissions and attaining the sustainable development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, may be a wild goose chase if the world does not protect the climate through 100% clean energy provision and completely break free from dangerous fossil fuel-driven energy dependence. The Nigerian government should not just sign an agreement to combat climate change but also take decisive action to break free from activities of greenhouse emissions that destroy our climate, our planet earth and our humanity”</em><span>        </span></span></p><p><span>It is this spirit of the need to stop the extraction of fossil fuel which informs the Break Free from Fossil Fuels movement. Break Free from Fossil Fuels is a two-week global wave of escalated citizen led actions to keep coal, oil and gas in the ground. According to key organizer of the Break Free movement and Director of Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF) Nnimmo Bassey, <em>“The time has come to make fossil fuels history and give our environment and peoples a chance to recover from decades of unrelenting oil pollution. By our actions we are standing in solidarity with communities in the oilfields of the Niger Delta, and other impacted communities around the world, demanding that our appetite for dirty energy must not be allowed to destroy the planet and future generations” </em></span></p><p><span>In Nigeria, the realities are direr. After several decades of non-stop oil extraction, it is arguable that Nigeria is worse-off compared to other less endowed countries. On all key global development indicators, Nigeria fares badly. It tilts on the periphery of a failed state according to reports; it has one of the lowest electricity access in the world despite its huge crude and gas deposits, failing infrastructures, failing healthcare, failing educational systems, etc. It begs the question to ask, what has been the benefit of Nigeria’s fossil fuels? </span></p><p><span>In the Niger Delta where the extraction of oil and gas takes place, the situation is alarming. The constant flaring of gas and regular oil spills has rendered the region an ecological disaster zone. Several known and unknown illnesses, a depressingly low life expectancy rate, loss of agricultural livelihood sources, regular conflicts and unprecedented poverty are all the bequests of extraction. &#34;<em>If there are still people who doubts the devastating effect of the fossil fuel business on the environment, citizens’ livelihoods, well-being and their very life, the terrible experience of Ogoni, tells it all. If the Ogoni people had a second chance, they will choose their environment over crude oil. <span> </span>They will prefer to keep their sons and daughters including Ken Saro Wiwa and thousands of others who became victims of this deadly business. Breaking free from fossil fuel will save the world from having another Ogoni &#34; <span> </span></em>says Celestine Akpobari of the Ogoni Solidarity Forum. </span></p><p><span>In Nigeria, the Break Free from Fossil Fuels campaign will kick off on the 10th of May at Oloibiri, the site of Nigeria’s first oil well. The abandoned oil wells in Oloibiri tell the story of what becomes of communities (or countries) when their oil wells run dry. </span></p><p><span>On the 12th of May, the campaign will move to Bori in Ogoni, another sad tale of the devastation, internal crises, wanton pollution and poverty which oil extraction brings.<span>  </span></span></p><p><span>On the 14th of May, the campaign will arrive at Ibeno in Akwa Ibom state where Exxon operates an offshore oil field from where its compromises community livelihood through regular pollution. In each of the locations, there will be mass actions by climate activists and communities demanding an end to the extraction of fossil fuels. </span></p><p><span>According to Ken Henshaw of Social Action and member of Nigeria organizing team of the Break Free campaign, “<em>this global campaign is the type of citizens’ led shock therapy that is needed to make the world realize that our dependence on fossils is destroying our only habitable world. Fossil fuels may seem attractive and something we cannot do without, but so did stone seem just before mankind moved away from the Stone Age; so did typewriters before we moved over to computers.

For example, the price of kerosene, the poor man’s fuel has remained extraordinarily high and their pleas continue to fall on deaf ears”, says Nnimmo Bassey, the Director of Health of Mother Earth Foundation. “We have always said that if there ever was any subsidy, it was the impoverished peoples of the polluted oil field communities that have been providing that subsidy. They continue to subsidise the cost of petroleum products with their lives and by environmental costs that are never brought into consideration.”</p><p>HOMEF believes that basing the price of petroleum products on importation costs is questionable planning and an abject abnegation of responsibility by the government. That sort of arrangement would be tenable when Nigeria decides to transit to a post petroleum economy and shut in the dastardly polluting petroleum sector and move on to truly productive and jobs-generating sectors.</p><p>“If the importers of petroleum products have to source their foreign exchange from the black market, Nigerians should be ready for pump prices that will go through the roof,” cautions Cadmus Atake, Project Officer on climate/fossil fuels at HOMEF. “Has the Black Market become our Central Bank?” Atake asked.</p><p>Bassey agrees and adds that official endorsement of black market forex deals is a roundabout way of devaluing the Naira, while living in denial of the fact.

Consequently, hunger  is due to bad governance, poor infrastructure for preservation and distribution of food and lack of adequate all round support to small holder farmers who constitute over 70% of the farmers in Nigeria. We, therefore, stornly recommend to  the Nigerian  Government to invest more in agriculture.</p><p>The Nigerian Biosafety Law, in its present form, is a recipe for the  destruction of Nigeria’s ecosystem, food cultures and systems. The process leading to its passage was devoid of critical input and public participation that would have enabled Nigerians to significantly determine and protect their food cultures and systems. It  lacks legal safeguards for protecting their rights.</p><p>We observe that the public hearing at the National Assembly did not meet an acceptable, minimum, global standard and  best practices in a democratic society. The hearing was just a  formality to create the semblance of a democratic process and skewed in favour of the GMOs Trans-National Corporations. The Government should not only introduce appropriate mechanisms but repeal the laws seeking to legalise and  adopt GMO seedlings and food products and consequently marginalize Nigerian farmers.</p><p>Furthermore, the Nigerian Bio-SafetyLaw is not in  the interest of Nigerian farmers and the wider public because it facilitates the introduction of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) on a massive scale that  violates the <strong>precautionary principle</strong>, which forms the basis of the African Union’s revised African Model Law on Biodiversity, to which Nigeria is a signatory.</p><p>We adopt the comments of Health of Mother Earth Foundation and Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria on the relevant sections of the Bio-Safety Law and strongly suggest their incorporation into the Nigerian Law to safeguard the rights of Nigerian citizens and protect Nigeria’s ecosystem.</p><p>The potential socio-economic, cultural and ethical impacts of GMOs are enormous and  diminish the positive impacts of small holder farmers who are feeding the country; promoting  cultural practices, community well-being, traditional crops and varieties; reducing rural unemployment; engendering trade; raising the quality of life of indigenous peoples; and re-affirming food security.</p><p>Aware that the UN recognizes socio-economic consideration as a key element in biosafety negotiations and decision-making processes (<em>Protocol  on  Socio-Economic Considerations; Article 26</em>), we, therefore, appeal to the Federal Government to conduct a socio-economic impact assessment of GMOs before the Government takes measures that destroy Nigeria&#39;s agricultural sector.</p><p>The concern about Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) is not only about safety  for consumers, we are equally concerned about the more damaging  systematic appropriation of the rights to seeds by the Trans-National Corporations that deprives farmers of their traditional rights to seeds, in favor of patents by multinational corporations (<em>South</em>-<em>South</em> <em>Dialogue</em> <em>Conference</em>).</p><p>There has been intensive and sustained propaganda on the positive contributions of GMO on food security questions, very little has been done to draw attention to the inherent risks and hazards of industrial mono-cropping and consumption of GMOs  such as loss of biodiversity, destruction of livestock, land grabbing,  land and environmental degradation, communal conflicts over land and loss of rights. Therefore, there is an urgent  need to present the true and full picture to Nigerians.</p><p>Industrial agriculture has no real contribution to national food sovereignty of Nigeria. It is part of the western development and capitalist economic regime bent on making Africa remain a cheap resource continent and market for finished products.  More fundamentally, the GMO project is anti-creational. It disturbs, contradicts and destroys the ecosystem. God created every plant and vegetable with its seed in it. </p><p>We implore our policy makers to learn from the experience of Burkina Faso and a host of other countries that are rejecting the GMOs and their false gospel of agricultural development. We maintain that  Nigeria’s food sovereignty lies in investing aggresively in agricuture, empowering small holder farmers, and practicing agri-ecology that is sustainable and environment-friendly.</p><p> </p><p>Signed:</p><p>Rev  Aniedi Okure, OP (Executive Director <em>AFJN)                  </em></p><p> </p><p>Nnimmo Bassey (<em>Executive Director HOMEF)</em></p><p>Fr.

We restate here that Monsanto’s applications were approved without due diligence and that the law setting up NBMA is extremely flawed in that it gives individuals in the agency the latitude to toy with the health of Nigerians, our environment and food systems. Contrary to Monsanto’s claims, IARC concluded that there was strong evidence of genotoxicity and oxidative stress for glyphosate entirely from publicly available research, including findings of DNA damage in the peripheral blood of exposed humans.</span></p><p><span>May we be reminded once again that NBMA signed the permits on a Sunday - a public holiday, when government offices were closed and just one month and a few days after the applications were opened to the public for comments. <strong>NBMA says it was “convinced that there are <span>no known adverse impacts </span>to the conservation and sustainable use to of biodiversity taking into account risk to human health</strong>.” However, it is instructive to note that the BT cotton submitted or rather recycled in Nigeria by Monsanto is a replica of the BT Cotton application that it had submitted in Malawi in 2014. That application <span> </span>in Malawi was <a href=\"http://www.gmwatch.eu/news/archive/2014/15522-monsanto-faces-strong-opposition-to-gm-cotton-from-malawi-civil-society\">opposed</a> on scientific,<span>  </span>legal and socio-economic grounds. That application has not been approved at the time of this writing. They recycled the application here and we opposed that application on similar grounds.</span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>Monsanto argues that their GMOs and their weed killers are safe. The truth is that the company is good at avoiding liability while exploiting the agencies that ought to regulate them. They claim, “A big part of that confidence comes from knowing that independent experts who’ve looked at GMOs have concluded that they’re as safe as other foods. That includes groups like the American Medical Association and the World Health Organization, as well as government agencies like the FDA.”</span></p><p><span>This is an interesting argument. We quote <a href=\"http://www.gmwatch.org/articles/gm-quotes/16079-regulatory-breakdown\">two statements</a>, one from Monsanto and the other from FDA and leave the public to read between the lines.</span></p><p><strong><span>Philip Angell, a Monsanto’s director of corporate communications said:</span></strong><span> “Monsanto should not have to vouchsafe the safety of biotech food. Our interest is in selling as much of it as possible. Assuring its safety is the FDA’s job.” </span></p><p><span>For the <strong>US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</strong> “Ultimately, it is the food producer who is responsible for assuring safety.” </span></p><p><span>When Monsanto and FDA makes statements like these, the reading is that consumers are left to literally stew in their soups.</span></p><p><span>In the words of <strong>David Schubert, Professor and Head of Cellular Neurobiology Laboratory at the Salk Institute of Biological Studies, La Jolla, California;</strong></span></p><p><span>“One thing that surprised us is that US regulators rely almost exclusively on information provided by the biotech crop developer, and those data are not published in journals or subjected to peer review... The picture that emerges from our study of US regulation of GM foods is a rubber-stamp ‘approval process’ designed to increase public confidence in, but not ensure the safety of, genetically engineered foods.” </span></p><p><span>This is exactly what is happening in Nigeria today, unfortunately. We have an agency that disrespects the voices of the people, ignores national interests and blatantly promotes the interests of biotech corporations. The relationship between National Biosafety Agency (NBMA), National Biotechnology Development Agency (NABDA) and Monsanto is rife with conflict of interest against the Nigerian people. How is it that the regulated is so influential on the regulator? The evidence in <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/03ABUJA250_a.html\">leaked Wikileaks</a> cables<span>  </span>is clear.<span><span>How can we have NABDA sit on the Board of NBDA, be a co-applicant with Monsanto and then sit to approve the application? This should fit into the definition of corruption in this season of Change. </span></span></span></p><p><span>Monsanto has been desperate to tell the world that their weed killer laced with the ingredient known as glysophate is safe. The debate about the safety of glysophate has been interesting with Monsanto in this response to Premium times claiming that <em>“<span>glyphosate poses no unreasonable risks to humans or the environment when used according to label instructions.”</span></em></span></p><p><span>The above claim says two or more things. First that glysophate poses risks. Secondly that this risk can be tolerated when the chemical is used according to label instructions. Thirdly, when something goes wrong, Monsanto will absolve itself of culpability by claiming that the chemical was not used “according to label instructions.”</span></p><p><span>The scientific debate over whether glysophate causes cancer continues, but based on research several countries have banned the use of the chemical. The very fact that there is no consensus on the safety of glysophate is the reason why Nigeria must apply the precautionary principle. It is interesting that Monsanto accuses IARC of selective interpretation of scientific data. This is a case of a kettle calling a pot black. We doubt if there is any other corporation that engages in selective interpretation of data more than Monsanto.</span></p><p><span>Despite Monsanto’s claims that glyphosate is safe, French Minister for Health, Marisol Touraine has said that France will ban Glyphosate – whether or not the EU decides this week to renew the authorisation of the chemical.</span><span> <span>According to her “the studies we have show it’s an endocrine disruptor.” </span></span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>Earlier this year, a poll by the international market research firm YouGov found that two-thirds of Europeans want the chemical banned. According to the survey of more than 7,000 people across the EU’s five biggest states, the banning of glyphosate was supported by 75% of Italians, 70% of Germans, 60% of French and 56% of Britons.<span>  </span>It is clear so many people around the globe do not want Monsanto’s modified crops or toxic chemicals, so why are they still aggressively pushing and promoting it around the world; dismissing environmental, heath, socio- economic concerns and circumventing government regulations?</span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>Talking about research, a high court in Paris <span> </span>punished a high ranking official representing Monsanto’s interests for deceitfully covering up research data proving that Monsanto was <a href=\"http://www.rapaluruguay.org/transgenicos/Maiz/Genetically_Maize.pdf\"><span>hiding toxicity of its own corn</span></a>. </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>Another report revealed that Monsanto marketed its potent weed killer glyphosate, a key element in their Roundup, and the corn and soybeans genetically engineered to withstand it by claiming that it would replace other, more toxic weed killers such as atrazine on American farmland. It didn’t happen. Recent scientific research suggests that both atrazine and glyphosate are more harmful than scientists once thought. For instance, several studies have shown that frequent exposure to glyphosate <a href=\"http://www.ewg.org/agmag/2016/05/does-monsanto-s-glyphosate-cause-cancer\"><span>doubles a person’s risk</span></a> of developing a blood cancer known as Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. “In light of new evidence on the dangers of glyphosate, European Union nations <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-eu-glyphosate-idUSKCN0YS0Y0\"><span>failed to pass</span></a> a short-term extension of glyphosate’s license for agricultural use when they voted on this on June 6, 2016. <a href=\"http://www.ewg.org/agmag/2016/06/gmos-haven-t-cut-weedkiller-use\">The pesticide could be barred in the EU</a> as soon as next month.”</span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>From the antecedents of Monsanto when it comes to cutting corners when it comes to risk assessments we have<span>  </span><span> </span>no inclination to give it any benefit doubt. <span> </span></span></p><p><span>There was a time when scientists insisted that cigarettes do not cause cancer. Today that has been exposed as a lie. Monsanto claims that their liability over PCB is over an historical misdemeanour. This is another problem with Nigeria’s Biosafety Act. If problems emerge in future over toxic chemicals introduced into the Nigerian environment today, Monsanto will go free because the law does not have provisions for strict liability. Meanwhile we remind ourselves that if toxic PCB is in history, so is Monsanto’s Agent Orange, the defoliant used in the Vietnam war and the toxic template on which the company continues the business of killing biodiversity.</span></p><p><span>GMOs are basically regulated because their safety is in doubt. The approval granted Monsanto to conduct field trials of genetically modified maize requires that these crops should keep a distance of 20m from non GMO farms. That is absolute nonsense and is designed to ensure that our natural maize varieties are contaminated. It is known that pollen grains travel several kilometres. Contamination has been one key tool used by Monsanto in countries like USA and Canada to chase after non-GMO farmers that actually are the victims of this companies polluting activities.</span></p><p><span>Our agricultural systems, eating habits and cultural requirements are not the same as those of Americans, for example, and bringing these crops into our country will expose us to unimaginable health impacts.</span></p><p><span>We would also be closing markets against ourselves. A case in point is a recent refusal of Brazil to buy corn from the USA, </span><span><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-08/gmo-concerns-stop-brazil-chicken-producers-buying-u-s-corn\">due to GMO concerns</a><span>, even in the face of shortage of corn needed in chicken feed. Note that Brazil is a country already with other varieties of GMOs! <span> </span></span></span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>Finally,<a name=\"_GoBack\"></a> we ask, are we so stupid that a genetically modified crop, Bt Cotton, that just failed in neighbouring Burkina Faso, (and the farmers are making claims from Monsanto) is what we are glibly opening our country to? Are we having regulators or GMO traders making decisions over our destiny?</span></p><p><span>Monsanto should note that its We the People of Nigeria, not Corporations and agrochemical Companies like Monsanto that will dictate the food system we want. </span></p><p><span>We restate our stand that the so-called permit issued to Monsanto to introduce GMOs into Nigeria should be overturned and the Biosafety law itself should be repealed. We also call on the National Assembly to urgently investigate the process leading to the granting of the permit on Sunday, 1st May 2016 to assure Nigerians that we are not pawns in a commercial game to open Africa to toxic technologies. </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>By Nnimmo Bassey</span><span><a name=\"_ednref1\" href=\"#_edn1\">[1</a>]<a name=\"_ednref1\" href=\"#_edn1\"></a></span><span>, Mariann Bassey Orovwuje</span><a name=\"_ednref2\" href=\"#_edn2\"><span>[2]</span></a><span> and Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour</span><span><a name=\"_ednref3\" href=\"#_edn3\">[3]</a></span><span> </span></p><p><span>-----------------------------------</span></p><p><span><a name=\"_edn1\" href=\"#_ednref1\"><span><span><span><span><span>[1]</span></span></span></span></span></a><span>Nnimmo Bassey, Director, Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF)</span></span></p><div><div id=\"edn1\"><p><span><a href=\"mailto:nnimmo@homef.org\">nnimmo@homef.org</a> </span></p><p><span>Tel: +234 803 727 4395</span></p><p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><a name=\"_edn2\" href=\"#_ednref2\"><span><span><span><span><span>[2]</span></span></span></span></span></a><span>Mariann Bassey- Orovwuje,</span></p></div><div id=\"edn2\"><p>Food Sovereignty Manager/Coordinator ERA/FoEN and Friends of the Earth International (FoEI)</p><p><a href=\"mailto:mariann@eraction.org\">mariann@eraction.org</a></p><p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\">+234 703 449 5940</p><p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><a name=\"_edn3\" href=\"#_ednref3\"><span><span><span><span><span>[3]</span></span></span></span></span></a><span>Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour</span></p></div><div id=\"edn3\"><p>Convener Nigerians Against GMO</p><p>grv@nogmong.com</p><p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\">+234 703 428 9598</p></div></div>','We have read with interest Monsanto’s defence of NBMA in its response to Premium Time’s report highlighting NBMA’s surreptitious granting of permits to them to bring their GMOs and glyphosate into Nigeria.

This is what underscores the imperative of the NDDC despatching its mandate with creativity, focus and zeal.</p><p>The Niger Delta Development Master Plan<a name=\"_ednref3\" href=\"#_edn3\">[3]</a> prepared by the NDDC offers a list of key issues in the region. We reproduce them here:</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst\">·      Widespread poverty, high disease burden and high mortality rate among children</p><ul><li>·      Poor sanitation </li><li>·      Limited employment opportunities</li><li>·      Poor transportation systems</li><li>·      Poor telecommunications</li><li>·      Poor electricity supply</li><li>·      Land scarcity</li><li>·      Poor educational and health facilities</li><li>·      Poor governance</li><li>·      Severe environmental degradation</li><li>·      Insecurity</li></ul><p>Although the above is quite an alarming list, you all know that it merely scratches the surface when we look critically at the immense deficits that we have in virtually every indicy of human development.</p><p><strong>1.00     Our Environment</strong></p><p>The natural environment is one in which no modifying or transforming human activity has taken place. When man moves in and interferes one way or the other with natural systems the result is either a liveable environment or one that swallows is inhabitants.</p><p>Stakeholder Democracy Network (SDN) captures the interlocked problems of the Niger Delta in these words:</p><p><em>The majority of the Niger Delta inhabitants lack access to basic infrastructure, health and education services as well as job opportunities. High levels of pollution and destruction of traditional means of livelihood increase the vulnerability to poverty in the region. The fundamental conditions of extreme deprivation have remained unchanged for decades and drive cycles of violent conflict.<a name=\"_ednref4\" href=\"#_edn4\"><strong>[4]</strong></a> </em> SDN went on to say that the problems are self-reinforcing.</p><p>An alarming 80 percent of rural populations and 56 per cent of urban populations in the Niger Delta do not have access to safe drinking water.<a name=\"_ednref5\" href=\"#_edn5\">[5]</a> Not surprisingly, citizens’ perception in the Niger Delta of the water they drink as unsafe has been found to be as high as 78 per cent. 66 per cent of citizens also affirmed that human waste flows back into some of the communities during rainy season.<a name=\"_ednref6\" href=\"#_edn6\">[6]</a></p><p>The environmental degradation that has placed the Niger Delta firmly on the map of infamy are those related to oil spills and gas flares. The present government says that gas flaring will end in 2020. That dateline is much better than the no-dateline scenario that was presented in the moribund Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB).</p><p>In the present context the new PIBs will come piece-meal in four parts. However, focus is mostly business and there is scant attention to the environment or the people. It is thought that the PIB will come in four parts arranged as follows:</p><ol><li><span>The Governance and Institutional Framework for Oil and Gas Bill</span></li><li><span>The Fiscal Reform Bill</span></li><li><span>Licensing Rounds Bill</span></li><li><span>Revenue Allocation and Management Bill</span></li></ol><p>Although the speculated title of the PIB IV does not explicitly suggest any focus on the environment or communities<a name=\"_ednref7\" href=\"#_edn7\">[7]</a>, some commentators think that it is that fourth bill that may say something about the funds for communities.</p><p><strong>2.00     Our opportunities: Between PIB Politics and the Minerals and Mining Act (2007)</strong></p><p>The National Assembly and the Ministry of Petroleum Resources occupy key vantage points to leverage calm in the oil fields of the Niger Delta. They can make this happen by having communities take their place as true stakeholders in the management of oil revenues. This point cannot be overemphasized. It cannot wait until PIB IV before Nigerians know what is coming.</p><p>Continued resistance to this fundamental step is clearly not in the interest of Nigerians, especially when the 2007 Mineral and Mining Act has clearly stipulated benefits for communities and land owners where minerals are extracted.<a name=\"_ednref8\" href=\"#_edn8\">[8]</a> The fact that our existing petroleum laws were <strong><em>war</em></strong> legislations gave birth to discontent by the reason of the very spirit that created them. Militarisation of the region is inescapable way of enforcing the anti-people oil decrees and may work to lock-in a cycle of conflict that ought to be halted.</p><p>According to Idumange, <em>“The Petroleum Act of 1969 </em><em>(as amended and other legislations), the local communities on whose lands oil is exploited, have been divested of their entitlements to their land and the oil produced from it. Indigenes of the Niger Delta hardly ever benefit from the allocation of Oil Prospecting Licenses (OPL) and are totally excluded from crude oil sales notwithstanding the fact that it is the local communities and the people that directly suffer from oil spillage, gas flaring, acid rain, and other forms of environmental degradation and pollution.”<a name=\"_ednref9\" href=\"#_edn9\"><strong>[9]</strong></a></em></p><p><em><a name=\"_ednref9\" href=\"#_edn9\"></a></em></p><p>The multiplication of military formations in the creeks cannot be the way of the hole that we appear to be digging. Modelling the PIB after the Minerals and Mining Act would create a level playing ground and eliminate the many inequities and reckless environmental degradation that occurs in the oil fields communities as if they were no man’s lands.<a name=\"_ednref10\" href=\"#_edn10\">[10]</a></p><p><a name=\"_ednref10\" href=\"#_edn10\"></a></p><div><p><strong>Extracts from Chapter 4 of the </strong>The <strong>Nigerian Minerals</strong> and <strong>Mining Act</strong> 2007</p><p><strong>98.

Besides, the communities would have a stronger voice when they point to the fact that interferences by any means, bombs or hacksaws, punish the communities and their environment most because they were condemned to live in the degraded environments whereas the international oil companies can conceivably simply pack up their suitcases and leave.</p><p><strong>3.00     Who Owns the Resource? - Thoughts on Re-Source Democracy</strong></p><p>The second and a very important thought in this presentation has to do with our understanding and relationship with the gifts of Nature through the concept of <strong>Re-Source Democracy<a name=\"_ednref11\" href=\"#_edn11\"><strong>[11]</strong></a></strong>. You may ask, what has this got to do with NDDC and the quest for environmental security. Everything. One of the fundamental challenges we have as a people is our loss of memory of what we had in the past and the values that sustained them, before rapacious exploitation of Nature and primitive accumulation set in.</p><p>Re-Source Democracy urges a reconnection to the source of the gifts that we enjoy as humans, keeping in mind that we are one species among many others. It requires that we do not see Nature as a theatre of exploitation, and that we should move from <strong><em>resource</em></strong> to <strong><em>re-sourcing </em></strong>with Earth, intentionally reconnecting with our natural life source.</p><p>Re-Source democracy is a clarion call to protect, defend and replenish our Re-Sources and environment for the common good. It seeks to ensure that present generations enjoy what they have without jeopardising the interests of future generations. The concept is predicated on a culture that respects life and hinges on the premise that “the earth does not belong to us, we belong to the earth.” <a name=\"_ednref12\" href=\"#_edn12\">[12]</a> We inhabit our places on the Earth by birth and by citizenship rights. The Re-Sources in the territories where we find ourselves are best protected, preserved and multiplied when we use our knowledge to suitably relate to the Re-Sources to maintain our lives, culture, sciences, spirituality, organisation, medicines and food sovereignty. Re-Source democracy requires that mankind serves as stewards over natural Re-Sources and not as predators.</p><p>We all celebrate and defend our right to life. While we do that, we must also realise that nature has a right to maintain her cycles and that our life can only be supported by nature when she is able to maintain those cycles. Our rights do not supersede and must not subvert the rights of nature.</p><p>Re-Source democracy contextualises and integrates Re-Source management in a way that uses indigenous or local knowledge as a veritable base. For example, where some people see forests merely as carbon stocks or sinks, forest dependent communities see them as places of life and culture, as places where they obtain food, medicine, building materials and other non timber forest products. Communities living in harmony with nature ensure that the available Re-Sources are replenished and not depleted at a scale that degrades them. When non-forest community people look at forests what come to mind are possibilities of commercial logging, conversion into mono-crop plantations or securing them as carbon sinks. The idea of the forest as a carbon sink excites governments seeking foreign exchange earnings from the exploitation of natural Re-Sources and this excitement can get so feverish that brute force is used to expel forest communities from their territories.<a name=\"_ednref13\" href=\"#_edn13\">[13]</a></p><p><a name=\"_ednref13\" href=\"#_edn13\"></a></p><p>A clear understanding of our Re-Sources, their uses and intrinsic values is vital for their proper management. The same goes for a central need for our understanding of the harmful impacts of certain extractive activities including those of solid minerals, hydrocarbons and forest products. These, plus an interrogation of the meaning of progress and development help us to draw the line between what we can accept or reject in our environment.</p><p>Economic value cannot be the vital measure of Re-Source value. A clear rejection of the commodification of nature is necessary for sustainable management of our natural Re-Sources.</p><p>Re-Sources are gifts of nature and are either renewable or non-renewable. They are found on land or in the sea. They include living species and non-living things. The exploitation or use of these Re-Sources can be harmful or wrong when the majority population is not considered in the decision-making matrix. For instance, when land is appropriated for cultivation of crops for biofuel and farmers are displaced or indentured, we promote machines and the comfort of the rich over the rights of the poor to a life of dignity.</p><p>As attractive as biofuels appear to some people, severe socio-economic and other impacts on vulnerable small-scale farmers have been documented. These impacts range from land grabs to poor and unpredictable income from being absorbed into a cash crop arrangement that is totally out of their control. A case in point is that of a UK company, D1 Oils in Swaziland where farmers were co-opted as sharecroppers to cultivate jatropha with the assurance that the crop would grow on marginal land without needing much input from them. As it turned out, although jatropha was touted as a wonder crop and a hardy plant that would thrive on very little water, the farmers found that the claim did not play out in reality. They needed to water the plants regularly and in an area with water stress this turned out to be a herculean task. We do not need to state that the dreams of wealth turned into nightmares and horrors and the enterprise collapsed.<a name=\"_ednref14\" href=\"#_edn14\">[14]</a></p><p><a name=\"_ednref14\" href=\"#_edn14\"></a></p><p>If <em>Re-Source democracy</em> had been in place in Swaziland, for example, the poor farmers would have been given facts and full information about what they were being drawn into. Such information would have included the uncertainties surrounding the crop and the fact that there have not been sufficient studies on jatropha as a plantation crop. The result would have been different if local farmers had willingly undertaken to grow crops native to their locality. They would have utilised crops that are resilient to local conditions and would have drawn from local traditional ecological knowledge in nurturing them.</p><p><strong>3.01     Development Paths</strong></p><p>The current development path of the world sees resources as objects that must be exploited. In a heavily financialised world, resources are also seen as things to be manipulated and converted into cash. Nature and its resources are thus mostly valued in terms of money and power, sometimes totally forgetting that they have intrinsic values.</p><p>Re-Source democracy recognises that a Re-Source fundamentally belongs to Nature and may be enjoyed by communities or peoples who have traditionally held the territory where the Re-Source such as a forest or grazing grass exist. It removes the obstacles erected by the politics of access and process as well as of redress.  Such obstacles may vary depending on the objective of the demand or struggle. We recognise also that such struggles may be over Re-Source rights, environmental rights or the right to utilise available Re-Sources.</p><p>The alienation of humanity from nature happens in a way that is directly proportional to our proximity to desired Re-Sources.  The alienation from nature does not only keep us from seeing the intrinsic value of Re-Sources, it also blinds those who see them as money-spinners to any sense of responsibility when grabbing for them.  Re-Source democracy connects us to our roots, to nature and calls us to Re-Source with Earth, our source of life.</p><p>Current dominant development modes are energy intensive and require more and more Re-Sources to generate that energy to keep the machines rolling and to feed the appetite of humankind for consumption and for cash. In that process we often overlook the wellbeing of the planet itself.  The result of this outlook has been ‘resource’ conflicts and wars and extreme damage of environment through reckless exploitation. The conflict and the harm are certain to intensify as the non-renewable Re-Sources run out and as habitable environment for the reproduction of renewable Re-Sources reduce.</p><p>Wars powered by greed and faulty relationships with Nature’s gifts do not end easily and it is instructive to note that nations never really win such wars and conflicts. While citizens die or lose their limbs multinational extractive companies and weapons makers/dealers simply go on enjoying their profits.</p><p><strong>3.02     Recognition and Inaction</strong></p><p>The dire state of affairs has not escaped mankind. However, the acknowledgement of a problem does not necessarily lead to a readiness or willingness to solve it. The notion that we have the capacity to fix whatever we break leads us to ride roughshod over nature and her Re-Sources. It is equally easier to be irresponsible in our handling of Re-Sources when we can externalise the costs and consequences to the poor and the voiceless in society.</p><p>A case in point is the fact that the world knows that climate change is propelled by dependence on fossil fuels and other actions of man and yet despite years of warnings and multilateral negotiations, nations harden positions and continue in the wrong and harmful paths. Indeed, nations insist they have a right to pollute in order to catch up with others who polluted earlier (and are still polluting) and have through polluting made achievements that the neo-polluters desire. Sadly, environmental pollution is fast becoming a badge of progress.</p><p><strong>3.03     Environmental Defence</strong></p><p>In Re-Source democracy citizens are real stakeholders that work and receive benefits and not tokens or acts of charity. It provides the space for ordinary people to get together to establish rules in line with traditional as well as best available knowledge to safeguard the soil, trees, crops, water and wildlife that support their livelihoods. Re-Source democracy hinges on pragmatic politics and wisdom that our relations with nature cannot be left to speculators and manipulators of market forces. It ensures the right and responsibility to participate in decisions that determine our access to, and enjoyment of Nature’s gifts.</p><p>Acts of over consumption including grabbing of Re-Sources to meet needs of corporations and the super rich are acts of violence.  When we take more than we require we are eating up the ecological space of other species and of future generations. Re-Source Democracy demands that we develop the tool we need for ecological as well as cultural defence.</p><p>Our ways of life should complement and synchronise with the cycles and provisions of nature. At the same time our economic activities rely on extracting value from natural Re-Sources through direct use or through their transformation into goods and services. A basic tenet of defence of our Re-Sources is the right to prior informed consent. This includes the right to accept exploitation of Re-Sources in our communities/territories or to reject such actions. To aid such decisions communities must be fully involved in environmental and social impact studies before the commencement of and project. Although this is already required by existing Environmental Impact Act of 2004, Re-Source Democracy would ensure that communities are educated and informed of the availability and uses of this tool to ensure that harmful projects are not embarked upon in their territories.</p><p> </p><p>Other rights that would enhance Re-Source democracy are delineated in the provisions of the Nigerian Minerals and Mining Act 2007 <a name=\"_ednref15\" href=\"#_edn15\">[15]</a> to which we have already referred in section 2.00 above.</p><p> </p><p class=\"Default\">The Minerals Act ensures that companies or individuals do not ride roughshod over citizens’ rights as they seek to exploit available ‘resources’. The mining company cannot obtain a mining title without adequate consultation with landowners.</p><p class=\"Default\">In cases where land is privately held and may be affected by mining operations, the Act requires that government must obtain the consent of the private owner of land before mining title would be granted. Where there is no consent the private land in question would be out of reach to the miners. This is provided for under section 100 of the Mining Act, which reads:</p><p class=\"Default\"><em>When an application is made for Mineral title in respect of an area which includes any private land or land occupied under a state lease or right of occupancy, the notice of the application, shall be given in the prescribed manner to the owner or occupier of the land and consent obtained before the license is granted, otherwise the license may be granted with exclusion of the private land in question.</em></p><p class=\"Default\">Section 19 of the Mining Act also makes provision for the setting up of a committee to be known as Mineral Resources and Environmental Management Committee in each state of the Federation. Communities are to be represented on such committees and part of the functions of this committee is to advise the Local Government Areas and Communities on the implementation of programs for environmental protection.</p><p><strong>4.00     Cleaning and Staying Clean</strong></p><p>The third and concluding point of leverage is the offered by the imminent commencement of the clean up of Ogoni land and the Niger Delta as a whole. A clean up makes sense when there is a commitment by all to cease from polluting activities.</p><p>The NDDC Act has a broad list of functions for the commission. The function that concerns us particularly in this paper is the one which states that it is to:</p><p><em>Tackle ecological and environmental problems that arise from the exploration of oil mineral in the Niger-Delta area and advise the Federal Government and the member States on the prevention and control of oil spillages gas flaring and environmental pollution etc.</em></p><p>As stated above, the Board of NDDC has wide powers of discretion in determining what constitutes the other ecological problems besides the ones listed. This broad canvas is both an opportunity and a problem.</p><p>Strategic steps that the NDDC can take in this direction are</p><ul><li><strong>Stepping up advocacy and mass education</strong><span> on the critical need to keep the environment clean by demanding that oil companies replace their pipelines when due, keep their facilities in top conditions, stop incessant oil spills and clean up those that inevitably occur when they do.</span></li><li><strong>Train communities on environmental monitoring and reporting </strong><span>– including on oil spills toxicity; and set up networks of community ecological defenders</span></li><li><strong>Establishment of centres of excellence </strong><span>to training youths in scientific ways of pollution cleaning and soil restoration</span></li><li><strong>Provide safe drinking water in communities, especially in areas with frequent oil spills</strong><span>. The UNEP report on the Assessment of Ogoni Environment, for one, clearly stated that the waters our people there depend on are all polluted with hydro carbons and in some places with benzene a known carcinogen at levels 900 times above World Health Organisation (WHO) standards. It is astonishing that almost 5 years after the submission of that report our people are still drinking the waters that are known to be poisonous.</span></li><li><strong>Clean up of communities on the fence lines of refineries, </strong><span>including Nisisioken Ogale in Rivers State and Ubeji in Delta State.</span></li><li><strong>Sanitation, </strong><span>especially toilet facilities and a stoppage of open defecation.</span></li><li><strong>Clearing of water ways </strong><span>of invasive species such as water hyacinth and the use of the weeds in the creation of useful products – such as oils and organic fertilisers</span></li><li><span> </span><strong>Support legislative advocacy </strong><span>and work for a similarity between the laws governing petroleum and solid minerals exploration and extraction in Nigeria. In particular, support efforts to adopt/apply the strategic link between environmental and community concerns of the Solid Minerals Act in the petroleum sector.</span></li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>We have endeavoured to stress that our approach to ensuring a liveable environment stems directly from our intrinsic value of our environment and our capacity to stand as ecological defenders. We have also shown that this can best be done from a position of knowledge and readiness to use existing and new tools. There are low hanging fruits to be plucked – especially with a determined and undeterred clean up process – and available good will for the NDDC to clarify and to play its expected role. Now, as is often said, the ball is in our court.</p><p>Thank you for your attention.</p><p><strong>----------------------- </strong></p><p>These were talking points by<strong> Nnimmo Bassey, </strong>Director, Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF) at World Environment Day event organised by the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) at Port Harcourt on 1st June 2016</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>NOTES</strong></p><p>    </p><div><br><hr><div id=\"edn1\"><p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><a name=\"_edn1\" href=\"#_ednref1\">[1]</a> John, Idumange (2011) ‘The Impact of Niger Delta Development Commission in the Eyes of the Ordinary Niger Delta People’, The Nigerian Voice (8 September), <a href=\"http://www.thenigerianvoice.com/news/69436/the-impact-of-niger-delta-development-commission-in-the-eyes.html\">http://www.thenigerianvoice.com/news/69436/the-impact-of-niger-delta-development-commission-in-the-eyes.html</a> Accessed 29 May 2016</p></div><div id=\"edn2\"><p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><a name=\"_edn2\" href=\"#_ednref2\">[2]</a> Aston-Jones, Nick (1998) <em>The Human Ecosystem of the Niger Delta- An ERA Handbook</em>, Benin City, ERA.</p></div><div id=\"edn3\"><p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><a name=\"_edn3\" href=\"#_ednref3\">[3]</a> NNDC.

The meeting held at the Aluebo Town Hall, Ogale, Nchia-Eleme, Ogoni. Attendance was mostly from environmental monitors who had previously been identified and trained from the four Ogoni local government areas in Rivers state, as well as civil society activists, community activists and the media.</p><p>After presentations and deliberations in plenary and workgroups, the consultative meeting/training noted that the soil, air and water pollution which the people of the Ogoni area have been exposed to have adversely affected crop yield for farmers, fish yield for fisher folks and generally reduced the people’s ability to generate income and provide for their wellbeing. This fact has in turn exposed the community to unprecedented levels of poverty, destitution and deprivation.</p><p>The meeting also noted that air, soil and water pollution in Ogoniland has manifested in serious health problems which the people have had to deal with for many years. Some of these challenges ranging from various form of respiratory disorders, heart deficiencies, lung related illnesses, problems with the outer epidermis, reproductive disorders including stillbirths, foetal malformation etc., have not been appropriately studied or documented in any detailed manner.</p><p>On the implementation of the clean-up, the consultative meeting noted that the Federal Government has demonstrated significant commitment in commencing the clean-up of Ogoniland in response to the recommendations of the UNEP Report. The meeting was, however, worried that there were many cases of ongoing pollution in Ogoniland thus making the proposed clean-up rather complicated.</p><p>The consultative meeting also noted that while the government has held several meetings with various interest groups on the clean-up process, the process of consultation still requires further work. It noted that the multifarious expectations from the clean-up process is evidence that many people expect that process to become something it isn’t, and this could lead to a problem of unrealized expectations, which could seriously undermine the process. Similarly, the meeting noted that structures have not been instituted which makes the people part of the process as monitors of milestones and standards as well as actual agents of the clean-up. The meeting expressed fear that if this is not done, the type of community ‘buy-in’ and ‘ownership’ which is required for a smooth implementation process may be lost.</p><p><strong>Resolutions </strong></p><p>Based on the above, the consultative meeting reached the following resolutions and presents them as recommendations thus:</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst\">1.   Residents of pollution impacted sites in Ogoniland should immediately be provided with alternative source of drinking water in line with the emergency measures recommended by UNEP. The people have continued using and drinking water from contaminated sources since 2011 after the UNEP Report was made public.</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\">2.  All ongoing sources of pollution in Ogoniland should immediately be brought to an end. These include active bunkering activities which continues unabated in the Ogoni area; as well as the practice by the Military Joint Task Force of setting tankers impounded with stolen petroleum products on fire. The latter is an emerging major source of air and soil pollution with immediate devastating health impacts.</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\">3.     Given the fact that pollution has continued 5 years after UNEP released its report, it is recommended that the report be updated to reflect current realities. It is believed that the levels of pollution recorded between 2011 and 2016 may have changed the original findings significantly, necessitating a review of the report to establish new and more realistic baselines.</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\">4.     A comprehensive health impact assessment which should detail the health impacts of pollution on people who reside in pollution impacted sites should be carried out. This process will be a first step towards documenting the known and unknown health impacts of hydrocarbon pollution and planning remedial actions.</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\">5.     The process of consultation and sensitization should be intensified and carried on throughout the stages of the clean-up implementation process. This is to ensure that communities understand what each stage entails and what is expected in order to avoid possible confusion and misunderstanding which could result in conflict.</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\">6.     In all stages of the lead-up and actual implementation of the clean-up, care must be taken to ensure that the different components of the stages reflect the inclusion of all segments of the society, including consideration for women, youths and people living with disabilities.</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\">7.     In planning the clean-up, clear and verifiable milestones should be established and done so in such a way that all stakeholders are able to understand each stage of the milestones and when they have been met. This will ensure an active and healthy feedback cycle with all stakeholders.</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\">8.     In establishing milestones, the training of community members to act in different capacities in the clean-up, must be instituted as a critical means of community inclusion. The already established and trained group of Ecological Defenders drawn from the various Ogoni communities should be considered a component of this milestone.</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\">9.     In order to ensure that the clean-up activities enjoy the support of all current and future government establishments, an executive Bill proposing the establishing legal frameworks for the structures and funding of the clean-up process should be immediately sent to the National Assembly for consideration.</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpLast\">10.  Communities should do everything possible and necessary to create the enabling environment- devoid of rancour and conflict - for the smooth implementation of the recommendation of UNEP.</p><p>Signed:</p><p><em>Nnimmo Bassey- Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF)</em></p><p><em>Celestine AkpoBari- Ogoni Solidarity Forum</em></p><p><em>Ken Henshaw- Social Action</em></p><p><em>Emen Okon - Kabetkache Women Development and Resource Centre</em></p><p><em>Martha Agbani – Lokiakia Centre</em></p><p><em>Kentebe Ebiaridor – Oilwatch Nigeria </em></p><p> </p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>    </p><p><strong> </strong></p>','The Ecological Defenders noted that the soil, air and water pollution which the people of the Ogoni area have been exposed to have adversely affected crop yield for farmers, fish yield for fisher folks and generally reduced the people’s ability to generate income and provide for their wellbeing.

This is why the concept of &#39;common but differentiated responsibilities&#39; (CBDR) is seen as a key principle by which climate justice is introduced into the climate debate. This same reasoning led to the creation of the Annex I and non-Annex I categories of nations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in order to have those most implicated in the climate debacle take greater steps or actions to tackle the menace.</p><p class=\"p2\">Since the 15th session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 15) in 2009, the idea of having nations committed to emissions reduction at levels required by science has been sidelined. At COP 21 in Paris last December, leaders set targets for temperature increase of 1.5oC or &#39;well below&#39; 2oC. We remember that at COP 15, the lead negotiator for the developing-country Group of 77 (G77), Lumumba Di-Aping, denounced the 2oC warming target as &#39;certain death for Africa&#39;. He also characterised it as a type of &#39;climate fascism&#39; that was being forced on Africa. He wondered why Africa was asked to sign an agreement that would permit an unacceptable level of warming in exchange for $10 billion, and also being asked to celebrate such a deal.1</p><p class=\"p2\">At COP 21 the idea of binding emissions reduction targets was totally jettisoned, in a manner that underscores the high level of power play and global dominance by rich industrialised nations which are determined to avoid responsibility for the climate crisis. The Paris Agreement of COP 21 has been applauded by political leaders across the world and celebrated by mainstream media and transnational corporations mostly because it marked the first time nations agreed that action had to be taken to combat climate change. A close examination of the document shows, however, that the real agreement by political leaders was that: while climate change demanded action, they could essentially perpetuate business as usual, without recourse to what science requires. The actions they would take are called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). As the name indicates, nations state what they intend to contribute to tackling the looming crisis according to national interests, with the NDCs being subject to review every five years and coming into effect by 2020.</p><p class=\"p2\">It has turned out that if emissions are reduced at the levels nations have said they would contribute, we will be on track for a global temperature rise far above the &#39;well below&#39; 2oC target set by COP 21. We should note at this point that the polluting nations are punching far below their weight in terms of emissions reduction while the poorer, vulnerable nations have pledged to do much more than their fair share. That is the classic way of turning justice on its head.</p><p class=\"p2\">The Paris Agreement is loaded with good intentions that are not backed by commitments to take requisite action. Added to the NDCs, the agreement left a hole through which false solutions such as REDD+, geo-engineering, carbon trading/offsets and other market environmentalism schemes could gain ascendancy. &#39;Solutions&#39; such as REDD+ (REDD stands for &#39;reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries&#39;) transfer the burden of action to curb global warming to vulnerable forest communities, for example, in ways that further deepen their vulnerability. Meanwhile geo-engineering entails intentional weather modification efforts that essentially put the planetary climate thermostat into the hands of powerful entities that could be governments or corporations. Computer models used to check the impacts of pumping sulphates into the stratosphere, for example, indicate serious implications for nations in the Global South.</p><p class=\"p2\">Computer modelling in two peer-reviewed scientific papers showed, among other findings, that &#39;sulphate injections into the [Southern Hemisphere] could increase precipitation in the Sahel region by up to 100 mm/month, but decrease precipitation in the South West [of Africa] by up to 60 mm/month ... Similar results were found regarding NPP [Net Primary Productivity] with an increase in the Sahel region by up to 100% but a decrease in the South West by up to 60% and also in the Magreb area of up to 20%. [The authors also noted that] Brazil could see a decrease in both NPP and precipitation. In a scenario where sulphate is injected into the [Northern Hemisphere], the Sahelian region is subject to reductions in NPP by as much as 60-100% ... The precipitation pattern in the region could be affected by a reduction of 20-80mm/month ... In this scenario, Southern Africa could see increases in both NPP and precipitation.&#39;2</p><p class=\"p2\">Urgent actions are needed and they must not be such as would create more problems for the poorest. One of the factors that hamper climate action is finance. It must be stated here that if the ecological or climate debt owed the Global South were recognised and paid, there will be no debate about who contributes how much, and who can access, climate funds. The debates always tend to suggest that finding needed finance is a herculean task; meanwhile enough funds that could make a huge difference are stashed away in tax havens by a handful of individuals and corporations. A recent report by Friends of the Earth International shows that 13 richest persons in the world have enough money to provide renewable energy to all of Africa within 15 years, for instance. Meanwhile the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative is looking for $10 billion between 2015 and 2020 to tackle energy poverty on the continent. In terms of the Green Climate Fund, the target is $100 billion per year from 2020. Meanwhile, the rich nations are spending over $1 trillion a year on destructive military hardware and warfare. The point is that the money is there; what is lacking is commitment to face the planetary crisis.</p><p class=\"p2\"><strong>What are the implications of this lack of commitment and readiness to act?</strong></p><p class=\"p2\">The world is currently enamoured with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a fitting successor to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). If sustainable development is to be attainable and not an oxymoron, we must become conscious of the fact that the very concept of lineal development or growth is an impossibility on a finite planet. The targets or goals will remain mere pipedreams in a climate-changed world.  For the goals to be met, tackling global warming cannot be based on nationally determined contributions.</p><p class=\"p2\">The casualties of climate change are many. They include those whose nations, territories and communities are being washed away by rising sea levels, floods and coastal erosion. They include those whose lands are suffering desertification. There are casualties braving deserts, seas and oceans to find a foothold on higher lands.</p><p class=\"p2\">A major area of vulnerability is agriculture and food production. Real climate actions are needed to build resilience into agricultural systems before catastrophic climate change sets in. The 1996 World Food Summit declared that &#39;Food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life.&#39;3 This indicates that food security must rest on four pillars: availability of food, accessibility to food, suitable utilisation of food, and the presence of these three in a stable way. When hazards meet vulnerability, the inevitable outcome is disaster. No hazard is more pressing globally than climate change.</p><p class=\"p2\">Some 80% of the food in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia is produced by smallholder or family farms.4 They depend on natural resources such as forests and shrub lands for their livelihoods as farmers and pastoralists. They also depend on rivers, lakes and creeks for fish. The tragedy is that governments seldom think of the smallholder farmer when they think of agriculture. They think more of industrial agriculture which utilises chemical inputs with heavy dependence on fossil fuels. Apart from the concomitant land grabs, displacement of smallholder farmers, and destruction of food systems and ecosystems, industrial agriculture, including cash cropping through plantations, exacerbates climate change.</p><p class=\"p2\">Besides the threat to food security, there is a greater risk to food sovereignty. Understanding the difference between food sovereignty and food security is important for us to grasp the grave impact that climate change has on agriculture and nutrition. Food sovereignty speaks of the right of peoples to grow crops and produce foods that are healthy, suit their ecosystems and are culturally appropriate. Food security, in comparison, is concerned with having food in sufficient quantities. These two concepts are not opposed to one another, but rather food security is best secured in the context of food sovereignty. What does this mean?</p><p class=\"p2\">With a simple focus on food security, it does not matter what food a person eats, provided she eats something. The food could be totally alien to the individual, but to erase hunger, whatever food is available has to be consumed. Mere food security eliminates choice and forces people, for example, to eat genetically modified (GM) foods, even when they are opposed to the technology. This was the sore point that Zambia was confronted with when the country faced food shortages in 2002.5 At that time Zambia insisted on being given milled and not whole grain GM maize to avoid contamination of indigenous species. The struggle over what food to receive or reject became a source of big debates and geopolitical power play. A major newspaper in the country, the Zambia Daily Mail, had this to say: &#39;It is very interesting to note that for the first time Zambia was being forced to accept a gift. Doesn&#39;t this worry us as recipients, that the giver is insisting that we take the GM foods? Are the Americans just concerned about our stomachs or there is something behind the gift?&#39;6</p><p class=\"p2\">Increasing temperatures and freak weather events are bound to have profound impacts on agricultural systems. The magnitude of these impacts would determine how the remaining carbon budget is managed or expended. The race to colonise the atmosphere is on and will likely intensify with nations making voluntary pledges to cut emissions. The implication of such voluntary pledges and actions is that sufficient resilience will not be built into our food and infrastructural systems. That translates to the harsh fact that vulnerable nations and regions will be incapable of coping with resulting loss and damage.</p><p class=\"p2\"><strong>El Nino, La Nina and desert locusts</strong></p><p class=\"p2\">El Nino is a weather pattern which happens as a result of the warming of the Pacific Ocean near the equator, off the coast of South America. It occurs when trade winds off the Pacific coast of South America weaken, or at times reverse, letting the warm water of the western Pacific flow instead towards the east. This change sets off atmospheric changes triggered by the warm water displacing the cooler water that is normally found near the surface of the eastern Pacific. This abnormal weather situation sets in motion altered weather events in many parts of the world. It occurs every 2-7 years and does not have a regular pattern.7 This recurring cycle thus goes with variations in sea-surface temperatures, convective rainfall, surface air pressure and atmospheric circulation across the equatorial Pacific Ocean.  The opposite to this is called La Nina.</p><p class=\"p2\">A minimum 0.5oC temperature increase has to occur in the waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean near the equator for it to be considered an El Nino year. It is not clear how these phenomena will change in the age of climate change, but the associated precipitation variability on regional scales is likely to increase due to larger moisture availability in the atmosphere.8 With heightened unpredictability in precipitation as well as the cyclic occurrence of the El Nino and La Nina phenomena, it is obvious that food systems will come under greater stress and plans must be made to absorb or cope with the shocks.</p><p class=\"p2\">One cause to worry about these changes in temperature, rainfall and wind patterns associated with climate change is the effect they may have on the desert locust in Africa. The land mass from West Africa to the Horn of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and southwest Asia will be particularly exposed to the impacts of this highly destructive migratory pest. Warmer temperatures and increased rainfall in desert areas cause the locust to mature sooner and have a shorter lifecycle; the breeding season begins earlier than normal and continues beyond the usual. It is expected that with a combination of a general increase in precipitation, higher rainfall events and tropical cyclones in the Arabian Sea, locust numbers may increase more rapidly and, if not adequately controlled, may become plagues.</p><p class=\"p2\"><strong>Water stress</strong></p><p class=\"p2\">The quantity and pattern of rainfall affect the availability of water. Already we are seeing a significant shrinkage of a water body such as Lake Chad. Others like Lake Turkana are under threat from proposed dams and other factors. Lake Chad, located at the intersection of Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria, has shrunk from over 25,000 square kilometres in the early 1960s to less than 2,000 square kilometres. This has led to the displacement of farmers, pastoralists and fisherfolks. The resultant loss of livelihood is seen to be contributing to the violence in northeast Nigeria as well as in the country&#39;s Middle Belt region where violent conflicts between herdsmen and farmers flare up frequently.</p><p class=\"p2\">Water wars or conflicts will likely intensify as freshwater systems get salinised through sea level rise and incursion of seawater. It has been estimated that by 2030 climate-related conflicts will rise by 54% in Africa. This could be directly linked with the availability of water. Overall, it is estimated that by 2020 up to 75-250 million people in Africa will face water stress. Changes in rainfall patterns will affect the distribution and health of wetlands, streams and rivers. When rainfall is reduced in arid and semi-arid areas, serious water stress is experienced, while other regions may have increased rainfall and be confronted with new challenges on how to cope with floods.</p><p class=\"p2\"><strong>Biodiversity changes</strong></p><p class=\"p2\">Climate change and rising temperatures affect ecosystems in many ways. One vital way is through the spread of vector-borne diseases such as malaria. It is estimated that up to 90 million more people in Africa will by 2030 be exposed to malaria, already the biggest killer in Sub-Saharan Africa, due to weather variations.</p><p class=\"p2\">There are also effects on beneficial insects and birds, including those that help in the process of pollination. Pests and invasive and alien species can have direct impacts on livestock and general food production. For livestock, temperature variations affect the animals directly. It is projected that diseases such as West Nile virus, bluetongue or Lyme and schistosomiasis (bilharzia) may expand into new areas. Increased rainfall and flooding due to El Nino has also been implicated in outbreaks of Rift Valley fever in East Africa.</p><p class=\"p2\">Increases in pest infestation which result in health issues and loss of forages and water sources create more challenges. The changes in crop and livestock productivity would have implications for availability and accessibility to food, which could instigate disaffection and riots. These impacts will also be reflected in existing geographical variations in ways that could see increased productivity in some regions and reduction in others. Climate change can easily lead to the erosion of genetic resources, including crop, animal and fish species.</p><p class=\"p2\">Reduced rainfall and shrinking water bodies affect the presence and diversity of riverine fisheries. Assessments by researchers report that the impacts of climate change on fisheries and aquaculture will be felt most acutely in Africa and South Asia.9</p><p class=\"p2\">Climate impacts on forests directly translate to livelihood challenges for the estimated 1.6 billion people who depend on forests for livelihoods. Forests provide timber and non-timber products, and protect water sources and soils. Forests are vulnerable to droughts and increased temperatures. Climate impacts will include loss of forest biodiversity through tree mortality, fire outbreaks and human pressures.</p><p class=\"p2\">Human pressure includes conversion of forests into plantations, with the accompanying loss of biodiversity. It also includes the pursuit of infrastructural development such as roads through forests. A current case in point is a proposed superhighway that threatens to erode community forests as well as a major forest reserve in Cross River State in Nigeria. The sore point with the proposed highway is that the government revoked occupancy rights of communities within a 10 km stretch on either side of the highway. By estimates, the highway and the lands girding it would take up 25% of the landmass of Cross River State. Analysts insist that the superhighway can easily be re-routed to preserve the communities as well as enormous biodiversity which includes rare and endangered species. It is also noted that the highway will lead to massive deforestation with grave climate change implications.</p><p class=\"p2\">The 260 km road is planned to lead from a proposed deep sea port at Esighi in Bakassi Local Government Area through the Cross River National Park and up to Katsina Ala in Benue State, at a cost of 700 billion naira or about $3.5 billion. Observers think the project may be a cover for land grabbing, illegal logging and poaching and the destruction of habitats in the forests and reserves that are protected by law and preserved by custom. They question why a project of this nature would reportedly enjoy contributions from Nigerian banks without requisite preliminary surveys, plans and approvals.10</p><p class=\"p2\"><strong>Climate injustice and sundry impacts</strong></p><p class=\"p2\">The climate impacts we have discussed thus far illustrate inherent injustices: the poor and the vulnerable are the ones mostly at risk. Poor levels of social investment leave the poor vulnerable and without protection as unpredictable weather events manifest. They are the most hit by food losses, sicknesses, infrastructure destruction, droughts, floods and water stress. They are poor, and climate change makes them poorer still. They are the ones expected to take real climate action, like protecting their forests, yet they are the last to be compensated when the booty of market environmentalism (through the commodification of nature) is to be shared. Within this scenario lies also hidden gender injustice exacerbated by imposed gender roles, oppression and patriarchy.</p><p class=\"p2\">There were serious floods in various African countries in 2012. As we write this, there are warnings to communities in the flood plains of the Benue and Niger rivers to brace themselves for heavier floods this year. The floods of 2012 displaced 530,000 people in Niger between July and September, while six million were displaced with over 300 deaths in Nigeria. Thousands more were displaced in Mali, Kenya, Uganda, Chad, South Africa, Mozambique, Somalia, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Sudan, Mauritania and others.11 Flooding cost Mozambique a whopping $550 million in 2000 and lowered the national gross domestic product (GDP) by 1.5%. For Nigeria, the 2012 floods brought a 0.36% drop in GDP.</p><p class=\"p2\">With a 2oC warming above pre-industrial temperatures, it is estimated that there could be permanent reductions in per capita food consumption of 4-5 %. With current trends in temperature increase, about 20% of Sub-Saharan Africa&#39;s arable land may become much less suitable for farming by 2080.</p><p class=\"p2\">A paradigm shift from a one-dimensional characterisation of responsibility and suffering to dimensions of fairness and justice is necessary to move beyond the impasse in international climate negotiations and improve national-level policy-making. The inequalities which are associated with human-induced elements, unequal distribution of impacts, unequal responsibility for and disproportionate cost of climate change mitigation and adaptation have shaped vulnerability and capacities for adaptation.  There should be a shift from a simple dual classification of winners and losers derived from locations in sensitive biophysical systems to include political, economic and social determinants of vulnerability and adaptation capabilities.</p><p class=\"p2\">--- </p><p class=\"p2\"><em>Nnimmo Bassey is Director of the Nigeria-based ecological think-tank Health of Mother Earth Foundation and member of Steering Committee of Oilwatch International.

Notably, the bulldozing of forests, farmlands and sundry properties commenced last year without an approved Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Curiously, the government issued an edict dispossessing individuals and communities of lands lying within an incredible 10 km width on either side of the proposed superhighway. The area so proposed for this land grab covers 5200 square kilometres or an astonishing 25 percent of the landmass of Cross River State. The best argument presented by defenders of the proposal is that the massive land uptake of 10 km on either side of the superhighway is essential for the protection of the superhighway. If that argument is interpreted to mean that the government plans to keep the people away from the superhighway so as to protect it, we would like to know for whom the highway is meant.</span></p><p><span>To many observers, the fact that the highway starts from a proposed deep seaport and ends in a small Sahellian town suggests that the main intent may be the harvesting of timber from community and National Forests for export.</span></p><p><span>The promise by the government that it would replace each mowed tree with two or up to five saplings and that no one should worry about any deforestation ensuing from the bulldozing of existing forests is a brilliant narrative that is anchored on fiction. First, what species of trees would be planted? Secondly, what replaces the ecosystems that would be destroyed including the threatened endemic species in the five protected areas to be impacted by the project? The five protected areas to be directly damaged by the project include <span>Cross River National Park, Ukpon River Forest Reserve and the Cross River South Forest Reserve, the Afi Mountain Wildlife Sanctuary and the Afi River Forest Reserve.</span></span><span> </span></p><p><span>It is possible that the CRSG is not aware of what would be lost if the pristine forests are destroyed. We say so because the EIA presented by the State government to the Federal Ministry of Environment has a curious list of animals that are not found in the region in question, with some not even being found in Nigeria or Africa. This anomaly suggests that the EIA is a copy-and-paste document that is not site-specific and should be rejected outright.</span></p><p><span>In particular, the EIA lists <em>small Indian</em> and <em>Chinese alligators</em> among the species found in the Cross River forests. Other species that may have been created by the writers of the EIA include<span>, <em>black</em> and <em>white colobus monkey</em>, <em>Dent’s monkey</em>, <em>blue monkey</em> </span></span><span>and the</span><span> <em>roloway monkey</em>. </span><span>This is mind-boggling by any measure. The EIA lists 17 bird species whereas there are up to 400 species in the threatened forests. <span> </span>The consultants also repeatedly refer to the Cross River National Park as the Oban Group of Forests even though a name change took place in 1991.</span></p><p><span>Communities threatened by the project have repeatedly said that there was no free prior informed consent of the people to this project. They insist that they need access roads and are not averse to such access being provided. What they cannot fathom is why a State that prides itself as being environment friendly and climate conscious would plan to decimate the last remaining pristine rainforests in Nigeria. </span></p><p><span>The latest protest has come from women and girls of </span><span>Etara, Eyeyeng, Edondon, Okokori, Old Ekuri and New Ekuri, Iko Esai and Owai communities in Etung, Obubra and Akamkpa Local Government Areas in the state, under the aegis of the Wanel-Aedon Development Association (WANELDON).</span></p><p><span>In a protest letter dated 30th January 2017 tagged “Our Opposition to the Revocation of our Lands for a Superhighway” and sent by WALNELDON to President Buhari, the women proclaimed their “total opposition against Governor Ben Ayade’s revocation of swathe of all our lands for a superhighway.” They claim among other things, that they were excluded from all decision-making processes related to the project and that the project as an affront to their social and economic rights. The women also insist that the project would negate key Sustainability Development Goals (SDG) 1 to 5: No Poverty; No Hunger; Good Health and Well-being; Quality Education and Gender Equality.</span></p><p><span>The women note that they are ethnic minorities that are being made to suffer multiple discrimination and deprivation including by being rendered internally displaced persons (IDPs) and subjected to heightened vulnerability in other ways. For this and many other reasons, the request President Buhari to governor to “de-revoke” [ownership] of all their “lands including settlements, farmlands and forests.” </span></p><p><span>The women also demand that the superhighway should be rerouted and that the wishy-washy EIA being presented to the Federal Ministry of Environment should not be approved. We could not agree more. If the 10km land grab has been reversed, as claimed by the State’s commissioner for Climate Change at the 18th Bassey Andah Memorial Lecture held in Calabar recently, the CSRG should publish such a “de-revoking order” for avoidance of doubt.</span></p><p> </p><p><span> </span></p><p> </p><p><span> </span></p><p> </p><p><span> </span></p><p> </p><p><span> </span></p><p> </p><p><span> </span></p><p> </p><p><span> </span></p><p> </p><p><span> </span></p><p> </p><p><span> </span></p><p> </p><p><span> </span></p><p> </p><p><span> </span></p><p> </p><p><span> </span></p><p> </p>','','article',1486468708,1486469967),(180,'Record-Breaking Superhighway\'s 20km Right of Way Revoked','','','news',1487346231,1487347226),(181,'Nigerian Lawyers Demand Review of Biosafety Law','','','press_release',1487938142,1487942805),(182,'When Faith Questions Genetic Modification','','','article',1488531007,1488532559),(183,'Forest Monitors, Forest Protectors','<p class=\"Body\"><span><strong><span>Monitoring Our Community Forest </span></strong></span></p><p class=\"Body\"><span><span>Communities are best placed to monitor their forests because they live in the forests, depend on forest resources and readily notice threat and changes that occur in such forests. When the communities, such as yours, are especially dedicated to preserve forests, monitoring becomes a top priority. It is with this understanding that Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF) is engaging in the training of forest monitors in your community. This exercise is a follow up to our earlier forest dialogues and training on forest EIA. We believe that you will further train other monitors so that we build a strong network of forest watchers and defenders.</span></span></p><p class=\"Body\"><span><span>The monitoring training is developed in modules covering aspects including what forests are, the laws and regulations cover our forests, the health impacts of forest degradation, tools and methods for forest monitoring, reporting and ecological defence. In the training process, we will also stress the fact that a plantation is not a forest. This is something you know very well because a plantation is an enclave of monoculture and cannot provide the services that forests provide. Moreover, plantations are often out of bounds to communities except for individuals sometimes employed to provide cheap labour on them. The expansion of oil palm plantations in this part of the country is already impacting on the Cross River National Park (CRNP) and community forests. This monitoring training will equip communities to document changes, unauthorised entries/encroachments and duly bring such to the attention of relevant government authorities.</span></span></p><p class=\"Body\"><span><span>This effort is being conducted with the support of the Small Grants Project of the Global Environment Facility (SGP/GEF) and is targeted at ensuring that the pristine community forests of Cross River State, Nigeria, as well as the CRNP are not degraded, destroyed or converted through any action or activity inimical to the interests of the people and the planet. The immediate threat to the forests in the Cross River State is the proposed six-lanes Superhighway project that is supposed to stretch over a distance of 260 kilometres and connect a proposed sea port to Katsina Ala town in Benue State, Nigeria.</span></span></p><p><span><span>The Superhighway project met local, national and international outrage because of the threat it poses to the last tracts of rainforests in Nigeria and because the government also revoked your occupancy rights and that of individuals and other communities in the area lying within 10 km on either side of the proposed highway. The proclamation that the record-breaking land grab was for the purpose of creating a development corridor was not bought by you or by other communities and the general public. HOMEF applauds your resilience and defence of your forests and our collective heritage. It is salutary that the government of Cross River State has announced that the revocation order has now been annulled. This is the sort of outcome that we can expect from frontline ecological defenders such as you in the affected communities. We use this opportunity to call on CRSG to issue a gazette affirming the annulment of the revocation order and declaring that the community forests and the CRNP must not be assaulted by any act of land use changes or infrastructure development. This is the way to protect our biodiversity for our good, for future generations and for the overall good of the planet.</span> </span></p><p class=\"Body\"><span><span>We also call on the CRSG to assure the world that their threat to continue with the Superhighway project without an approved EIA was a grave error that would not be carried out. A situation whereby a state government flagrantly breaks the law would spell disaster for resource governance and could lead to a breakdown of law and order as the government itself would not have the standing to demand that project proponents within the state obey any of the state’s environmental regulations. We also note that the EIA in question has been shown to be unacceptable by the Federal Ministry of Environment and noted experts and groups including the Nigerian Conservation Foundation (NCF) and the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS). As the WCS stated in one of their reports, “the listing of the small Indian mongoose and Chinese alligator [in the EIA] is truly shocking and strongly indicates that the consultants may not be competent or qualified to undertake a project of this magnitude and importance.” </span></span></p><p class=\"Body\"><span>We reiterate the<span> call that the Superhighway should be realigned away from forests or, better still, the government should simply repair and expand the existing dilapidated highway.

This problem is even more pungent in Nigeria where the effects of fossil fuel related pollution and climate changes therefrom are emerging as a major disaster. From sea level rises that threaten to consume whole coastal lying communities to crude oil pollutions which continues to deprive many of viable livelihoods, the continues extraction and dependence of fossil fuels has devastating consequences for Nigeria and especially the Niger Delta. </span> </span></p><p><span>Recently the city of Port Harcourt and its environs has been plagued with massive soot, an outcome of incomplete hydrocarbon combustion processes. For months, the people have had to breath this poison while interacting with it on their skin, clothes and food items. The immediate and long term medical consequences of this will be severe. While the government at the federal and state level have failed to arrest this problem, or even confirm the source of this new threat, the people of the Niger Delta continue to live with routine gas flaring and routine oil spills while oil companies and government officials trade blame and the situation persists.</span></p><p><span>Rather than improve the lot of the people, oil and gas extraction has been the source of conflict, livelihood losses, social imbalance, environmental pollution and health threats. Indeed, due to soil air and water pollution which the people of the Niger Delta region are exposed to, life expectancy has dropped in the region. Despite several decades of oil extraction, Nigeria still fares miserably on all development indices, certainly worse than other less endowed countries. On all key global development indicators, Nigeria fares badly. It tilts on the periphery of a failed state according to reports; it has one of the lowest electricity access in the world despite its huge crude and gas deposits, failing infrastructures, failing healthcare, failing educational systems, etc. It begs the question to ask, what has been the benefit of Nigeria’s fossil fuels?</span></p><p><span>According to report by the United Nations Environment Programme UNEP, released after an assessment of environmental pollution in Ogoniland, the area has been so polluted that it might take up to 30 years of clean-up and remediation activities to bring it back to its pre- crude oil condition. Indeed, benzene, a chemical which causes cancer and other heart related diseases is contained in the water the people drink 900 times above safe levels. </span></p><p><span>Crude oil extraction and its attendant environmental and social problems continues not for a lack of alternative, but because the government has refused to explore other cleaner, cheaper and viable energy sources. Other countries are gradually moving away from fossil fuel as a source of energy, while Nigeria is increasingly embedding itself in this outdated practice. </span></p><p><span>It is this spirit of the need to stop the extraction of fossil fuel and begin the exploration of other cleaner and renewable sources of energy that informs the Break Free from Fossil Fuels movement. Break Free from Fossil Fuels is a wave of escalated citizen led actions to keep coal, oil and gas in the ground. Comrade Legborsi Saro Pyagbara, President of MOSOP, sees the action as timely. “Coming at this time, the Break Free action is an opportunity for us all to remind the Nigerian state that the clean-up of Ogoni environment should be seen as a step towards our turning away completely from dependence on polluting or dirty energy sources.</span></p><p><span>According to key organizer of the Break Free movement and Director of Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF) Nnimmo Bassey, <em>“The time has come to make fossil fuels history and give our environment and peoples a chance to recover from decades of unrelenting oil pollution.

Both Bassey and Rhodes-Vivour stressed that claims that GMOs offer higher yields, more profits to farmers or are more nutritious are mostly mere propaganda.</span></p><p><span>On health impacts of GMOs, </span><span><a href=\"http://responsibletechnology.org/10-Reasons-to-Avoid-GMOs/\">animal <span>studies</span></a></span><span> of </span><span>The American Academy of Environmental Medicine (AAEM) were cited showing organ damage, gastrointestinal and immune system disorders, accelerated aging, and infertility. Human studies also show how genetically modified (GM) food can leave material behind inside us, possibly causing long-term problems. Genes inserted into GM soy, for example, can transfer into the DNA of bacteria living inside us, and toxic insecticide produced by GM corn have been found in the blood of pregnant women and their unborn fetuses. It was also noted that the percentage of Americans with three or more chronic illnesses jumped from 7% to 13% in just 9 years after the introduction of GMOs in 1990s; food allergies skyrocketed, and disorders such as autism, reproductive disorders, digestive problems, and others are on the rise. </span></p><p><span>GMOs cross pollinate and pollen grains have been known to travel several kilometers thereby contaminating non-GMO varieties. It is impossible to fully clean up our gene pool once contaminated. GMOs reduce bio-diversity, pollute water resources, and are ultimately antithetical to sustainable agriculture. Self-propagating GMO pollution will outlast the effects of global warming and nuclear waste. The potential health impact is very huge, and has inter-generational implications. </span></p><p><span>Most GM crops are engineered to be “herbicide tolerant”. Monsanto, for example, sells Roundup Ready crops, designed to survive applications of their Roundup herbicide. With the rise of “superweeds,” that are resistant to the herbicide, farmers are sometimes forced to use even more toxic herbicides every year. Not only does this create environmental harm, GM foods contain higher residues of toxic herbicides. Roundup, for example, is suspected to be linked to sterility, hormone disruption, birth defects, and cancer.</span></p><p><span>By mixing genes from totally unrelated species, genetic engineering unleashes a host of unpredictable side effects. Moreover, irrespective of the type of genes that are inserted, the very process of creating a GM plant can result in massive collateral damage that produces new toxins, allergens, carcinogens, and nutritional deficiencies.</span></p><p><strong><span>Why are GMOs being promoted in Nigeria? </span></strong></p><p><span>The National Biosafety Management Act came into being on 18 April 2015 after the Bill was signed into law by the former President Goodluck Jonathan. The Act established the National Biosafety Management Agency (NBMA) that has the “responsibility for providing regulatory framework, institutional and administrative mechanism for safety measures in the application of modern biotechnology in Nigeria with the view to preventing any adverse e</span><span>ﬀ</span><span>ect on human health, animals, plants and environment.” (NBMA Act, 2015)</span></p><p><span>Mariann Orovwuje, who spoke on Nigerian Biosafety act, said the Act in itself is defective. Among many issues, </span><span>Biosafety Act does not take into cognizance the concerns of local farmers and critical stakeholders. Some of the problematic areas of the Act include the following:</span></p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst\"><span><span>·<span>      </span></span></span><span>The Act does not make public participation obligatory when applications to introduce GMOs are being considered.</span></p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\"><span><span>·<span>      </span></span></span><span>It does not specify clearly how large-scale ﬁeld trials would be contained and regulated to avoid contamination of surroundings or farms.</span></p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\"><span><span>·<span>      </span></span></span><span>Farmer organisations are not represented on the Governing Board. The Board has GMO promoters and vested interests.</span></p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\"><span><span>·<span>      </span></span></span><span>The Act does not state criteria for risk assessment nor does it stipulate that such assessments must be carried out in Nigeria and not o</span><span>ﬀ</span><span>shore. This is important because the e</span><span>ﬀ</span><span>ect of the GMO on non-target organisms has to be measured with non-target organisms that exist in Nigeria and are ecologically important.</span></p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\"><span><span>·<span>      </span></span></span><span>Strict liability and provisions for redress are not included in the Act.</span></p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\"><span><span>·<span>      </span></span></span><span>The Act does not ensure the implementation of the precautionary principle that entitles our government to decide against approval or for restriction in cases of incomplete or controversial knowledge. This is the essential feature of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (CPB), driven by the interests of African negotiators and should be implemented in Nigeria.</span></p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\"><span><span>·<span>      </span></span></span><span>No provision for mandatory labeling. </span></p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpLast\"><span><span>·<span>      </span></span></span><span>The constitution of the Board of NBMA makes the agency open to conflict of interests. It is populated with GMO promoters and this inhibits its role as an unbiased Biosafety umpire.</span></p><p><span>Institutions that are created to protec</span><span>t our environment and biosafety</span><span> are actually hand-in-gloves with corporations that are trying to flood our country with exotic and risky products and merchandise. </span><span>Our governments have been largely complacent about the covert activities of the biotechnology industry to undermine food sovereignty in Nigeria</span></p><p><span>According to Nnimmo Bassey (Director, Health of Mother Earth Foundation), “It was wrong of us to have established a biotechnology promotion agency (NBDA) when there was no regulatory body (NBM)] in place. The forces behind proliferation of GMOs in Nigeria are those of control and technology fostering dependency on the multinational corporations.”</span></p><p><span>One of the journalists shared this thought: “Genetic engineering of food is a seed for the re-colonisation of African countries and other developing nations. What the promoters of GMOs are trying to do is force down our throat a food programme that will not only destroy our natural habitat but could cause severe harm to our health.”</span></p><p><strong><span>What is the way out?</span></strong></p><p><span>There is inadequate information and awareness of the public on food sovereignty issues thus shutting out critical stakeholders, deepening public ignorance and inhibiting contributions to solutions. Sustainable food security is only way possible under the umbrella of food sovereignty – ensuring that right of the people to produce food that is healthy, culturally appropriate and produced using ecological sound methods. </span></p><p><span>According to Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour, “The movement to protect our food system is one that requires collective efforts. We must all take up responsibility to ensure we keep our environment free of contamination and protect our biodiversity. There is need for us to strengthen subsistence agriculture by providing adequate storage facilities, good access roads to markets, providing subsidies on farming implements, better access to farmlands and education of the public on the advantages of local food production.”</span></p><p><span>Akinbode Oluwafemi who spoke on the role of the media in promoting biosafety noted that the media plays an important role in publicizing basic information and findings from domestic and foreign research in order to raise public awareness and promote public participation in biosafety issues. The public requires such information to understand GMOs, assert their right to a safe and healthy food and to be able to make informed choices with regard to food.</span></p><p><span>The sessions were highly interactive and information documentaries were screened to buttress the points shared. Participants acknowledged that they were empowered by the training and will endeavor to promote public awareness on the issues of biosafety.</span> </p><p><span>One left the session reinforced in the conviction that GM crops and foods should not be allowed into Nigeria because they would not only create health challenges, destroy our natural ecosystem but also lead to the neo-colonization of Nigeria and Africa. <span>          </span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span> </p><div><hr>Reportd by <a name=\"_edn1\" href=\"#_ednref1\"></a><span>Joyce Ebebeinwe, Project Officer, Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF)</span></div><p> </p>','The task of ensuring that science responds to popular needs of society should be the major challenge that scientists have to overcome.

Last September, the <strong>International Criminal Court</strong> declared it would prioritise crimes that result in the “destruction of the environment”, “exploitation of natural resources” and the “illegal dispossession” of land and that it would now take many crimes that have been traditionally under-prosecuted into consideration.

Does science always serve the public interest? Nnimmo Bassey, director of Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF) posed these questions in his opening words at the media training organized in Abuja recently. The answers to these questions are obvious. The training session went ahead to question whether science was being used in the public’s interest in matters of food safety in Nigeria.</span></p><p><span>The training featured </span><span>top electronic, print and online media personnel in Abuja and Lagos and was focused on the issues of biosafety and the challenge of agricultural modern biotechnology.</span></p><p><span>GMOs, or “genetically modified organisms,” are organisms (plants or animals) created through the gene splicing techniques of modern biotechnology to possess certain characteristics that they do not naturally have. Such characteristics include the ability to withstand herbicides and also of making the organisms become pesticides.</span></p><p><span>The training sought to present facts that would help erase the tonnes of misleading information circulating about genetically modified organisms.</span></p><p><span>In his presentation, Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour, who is a Public Policy Expert and the Convener of Nigerians against GMO, said that problems started when the lines between public good and commercial interest became blurred, stressing that the scientists who should engage in proper research to ascertain and enlighten the public on the risks associated with GMOs were largely serving corporate interests, just as was the case when medical doctors were co-opted to present cigarettes as safe and promoted smoking. He also stated that even in the USA there is a dispute as to who has the ultimate responsibility of ensuring food safety. The question sometimes gets tossed between regulatory agencies in the USA and the manufacturers of GMOs.</span></p><p><span>According to Ify Aniebo, a molecular geneticist from Oxford University, the very process of gene transfer creates lots of problems as scientists do not have absolute control over the movement of such genes. These new genes can disrupt the functioning of other genes and create novel proteins that have never been in the food supply and could create toxins and allergens in foods.</span></p><p><span>Whereas the impact of eating GMOs may take years to manifest, the best tests that biotech companies such as Monsanto have conducted have been on rats for a mere 90 days. Tests done by independent scientist such as Professor Gilles-Eric Seralini over a two-year period, using same parameters as Monsanto, have shown sever impacts on the health of the laboratory rats. The rats fed GM potatoes were seen to have smaller livers, hearts, testicles and brains and damaged immune systems. They were more vulnerable to infection and disease compared to other rats fed non-GMO potatoes. Stomach and intestines cells proliferation was also observed and this could be a sign of greater future risk of cancer.</span></p><p><span>Another speaker at this training Jackie Ikotuonye-Offiah who is a botanist and Country Representative for Bio-integrity and Natural Food Awareness Initiative explained that GMOs actually increase the use of pesticides and herbicides instead of reducing them. </span></p><p><span>She cited a report by agronomist, Dr Charles Benbrook, that showed that GM herbicide-tolerant crops led to a 239 million kilogram (527 million pound) increase in herbicide use in the United States between 1996 and 2011. Apart from contaminating soils and making them unproductive for non-GM crops, the herbicides do also wash or seep into water bodies making them harmful for both aquatic species, animals and humans.</span></p><p><span>Should we embrace a harmful technology just because it is available?</span></p><p><span>Mariann Bassey Orovwuje, a Lawyer as well as an environmental and food rights advocate, spoke on the Nigerian Biosafety Management Act, 2015. She stated that this Act which is supposed to provide the regulatory framework, institutional and administrative mechanisms for safety measures in the application of modern biotechnology in Nigeria is flawed and incapable of protecting the people from the adverse impacts of GMOs on human health, animals, plants and environment.</span></p><p><span>She stressed that the Act rather than being a strict regulatory tool is rather a permitting instrument and does not make public participation obligatory when applications to introduce GMOs are being considered. Farmer and consumer organisations are not represented on the Governing Board, instead the Board has GMO promoters and vested interests on it. The Act has no provision for mandatory labelling which leaves the public with no choice in an issue as important as the food they eat.</span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><strong><span>What is to be done?</span></strong></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>It was a full day of robust presentations, debates and networking.

Many issues surround the matter of our food and agricultural modern biotechnology that require clarifications and in-depth interrogations. It is to this end that the Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF) on the 25th of April 2017 had a roundtable with lawyers in Abuja to look critically at the Nigerian Biosafety Act and decide if it is capable of regulating and preserving human and environmental health in Nigeria or if it should be urgently reviewed or repealed.</span></p><p><span>The director of HOMEF, Nnimmo Bassey, in welcome words said that access to safe and nutritious food is a universal right and modern agricultural biotechnology challenges that right with its creation of novel organisms dependent on toxic chemicals and abridgement of the rights of farmers to preserve and share seeds. He regretted the fact in some countries citizens are conned into eating unwholesome foods, some of which are actually classified as pesticides due to non-labelling of genetically engineered crops </span></p><p><span>Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour, a Public Policy Expert and the Convener of Nigerians against GMO, speaking at this event said the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is not the solution to food and agricultural problems in Nigeria. He explained that crops which are produced by the manipulation of their genes at the micro level pose severe risks to the health of man and the environment, adding that the promoters of this technology are driven by profit and not public interest.</span></p><p><span>Science has been of great benefit to mankind throughout life but it must be carefully harnessed to ensure safety and wellness. This was the position taken by another speaker at this event, Dr Ify Aniebo, who is a molecular geneticist. She underscored the fact that science itself has limitations. She explained that the process of transferring genes from the DNA of one organism to that of another organism could result in the creation of novel proteins which have never been in the food supply and could create toxins and allergens in food.</span></p><p><span>She stressed that there have not been enough studies to prove that GMOs are safe for consumption and called on the Nigerian government to invest in strict and independent scientific research to check the health, ecological, socio-economic impact of GM crops to ensure the safety of our food systems.</span></p><p><span>According to Jackie Ikotuonye-Offiah, a botanist and a Country Representative of Bio-integrity and Natural Food Awareness Initiative, the idea behind modern agricultural biotechnology is that of seed colonization as none of the arguments about GM crops hold true. These crops are neither more nutritious nor are they more productive than organic and conventional crops. They do not reduce pesticide use but instead lead to use of more toxic pesticides that contaminate both soil and water systems. Cost of Seed in the US for example, where GM firms dominate the seed market increased dramatically compared with prices for non-GM and organic seeds. </span></p><p><span>She posited that the solution to food challenge is in agroecology and organic agriculture and suggested increased and focused support for small-scale human centric agriculture. She urged the government to provide local farmers with extension services, food processing facilities and infrastructure to be able to convey farm products to the markets in good time.</span></p><p><span>The last session for the day focused on the Nigerian Biosafety Management Act. Mariann Orovwuje who is a lawyer and</span><span>an environmental, human and food rights advocate, spoke at on the concerns, risk assessment and permits of this Act. According to her, the law which was established in 2015 leaves gaps that can be easily manipulated to allow influx of GMOs without strict regulatory measures.</span></p><p><span>She explained that the Act does not ensure the implementation of the precautionary principle that places a demand on our government to decide against approval of GMOs especially in cases of incomplete or controversial knowledge. She also mentioned that the Act does not specify clearly how large-scale ﬁeld trials would be contained to avoid contamination of areas beyond the experimental fields.

Clearly, the environmental crises confronting the world is inseparable from the economic crisis. </span></p><p><span>The quest for materials and their transformation over the years have led to slavery, colonialism, autocracy and diverse socio-cultural corruption and manipulations. It has led to forceful dispossession of persons, communities and nations of their heritage through wars and other violent confrontations. This exploitative pathway, in which we have chiselled and drilled into the belly of the Earth, polluted our rivers and atmosphere, mowed down mountains, chopped down forests and poisoned our food systems, has taken humans further away from Nature over time.</span></p><p><span>Humankind’s quest for the control of Nature has led to the waging of unwinnable wars over natural forces and manifestations. Rising consumption and wastages have led to massive extinction of species and severe environmental changes – some of which may well be irreversible. Progress is largely measured by uniformity of products that yield to mass production, transportation and consumption. We seem to have forgotten that Nature thrives in diversities. This psychological and physical drifting from Nature is proving unsustainable as planetary boundaries and limits are being reached and exceeded. </span></p><p><span>The current global economic crisis will not go away as long as the current basis of relations stay. A capitalist economic system respects neither nature nor environment or peoples. It is based intrinsically on exploitative, competitive and non-regenerative relationships and cannot be sustained in perpetuity. When you don&#39;t regenerate, you are not restorative and your actions are firmly planted on the path of degeneration. Even the accumulation of wealth by the 1 percent has reached its peak and the only way forward has to be down.</span></p><p><span>The current system denies reality. That is why the president of arguably the most powerful nation on Earth can wake up and exit from a global effort to fight a common challenge: climate change. That is when power <em>trumps</em> good sense. This myopic power denies science and even defies reasonable self-interest.<span>  </span><span> </span>Although the Paris Agreement is largely inadequate, the pulling away of the USA, the second largest greenhouse emitter, from the global climate space, as outrageous as it is, only confirms that <em>power</em> only respects primitive self-interest. </span></p><p><span>Sustainability is not just a measure of a thing being available or useable in perpetuity. It also connotes its staying recognisable in form and speaks of intergenerational justice and responsibilities. </span></p><p><span>Re-Source democracy calls for a re-turn to the source, a re-connection to Nature. It calls for a recovery of memory. It calls for a dream of our preferred future or even multiple futures. It calls for the recognition of the fact that humans are just one of the species on Planet Earth and that we are a part of a system whose survival depends on interrelationships and solidarity. </span></p><p><span>To ensure Re-Source democracy, we have to be immersed in the defence of life and staying in the battle line against inequality as well as political and social injustices. We have to build a future that promotes cooperative and collaborative behaviours. That is what creates shared abundance, the good life or <strong><em>eti uwem.</em></strong> Scarcity is promoted by competition and that breeds all sorts of social and environmental misbehaviours. </span></p><p><span>Nature is self-regenerating, but human and corporate activities have brought in disruptions of those circles and cycles of life. Examples include the utter degradation of our environment by oil spills, gas flares, toxic wastes, industrial effluents and the like. It includes the exploitation of re-sources without prior informed consent of citizens in the territories. We have to pause to ask what the Niger Delta will look like by the close of the century. What would be the situation of the far North if desertification is not checked? What would be the case of our territories if gully erosion and deforestation continue unabated? </span></p><p><span>Environmental degradation disrupts our linkages to Nature, shrivels our humanity and throws us into unhealthy rivalry and struggles for whatever goods remain. It alters our thought patterns and social relations. It makes the unacceptable appear attractive and even acceptable. How would anyone drink water that is visibly polluted or eat foods that are clearly known to be toxic? How would we accept these without major uprisings? </span></p><p><span>What would make Nigeria stay in the present unsuitable unitary national architecture fabricated by military adventurers to suit their command structure? How could we dream of building a democratic and federal nation on the basis of autocratic and dictatorial military scaffolds? More questions can be asked, but let us restrict ourselves to the way we have treated Nature’s gifts to our nation. The arrival of crude oil and petroleum resources literally poisoned and damaged our environment, economy, politics and socio-cultural relationships. Agriculture got ignored, manufacturing got side-lined and all eyes got riveted on US dollars flowing into the national pot. We became captives of voodoo economics. Do nothing, grab everything.</span></p><p><span>Re-Source Democracy requires that we train our eyes to see what Nature has presented to every community and to what extent the communities are involved in decisions that affect the exploitation, protection or use of the re-sources in their territories. It requires that no one gets killed or colonised simply because of such endowments. It requires that we question how what we have is utilised and on what basis. It is about our right to life, freedom from contamination and respect of the Rights of Mother Earth.<span>  </span></span></p><p><span>We have hopes that unpacking the concept of Re-Source Democracy will provide us with ideas on how to redirect the nation from divisive and exploitation pathways and provide the platforms for truly democratic relationships with each other and with Nature – one that is built on local knowledge and wisdom. It should help us cultivate mutual respects between the many groupings in our nation. It should above all help encourage us to handle the gifts of Nature with due deference. </span></p><p><span>The Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Uyo provides an excellent academic environment for the interrogation of this existential challenges.

The meeting was attended by 150 people including representatives from forest communities, CSOs, government and the media. At the meeting, it was resolved that we must continue to demand for justice for our environment and communities. The following are the outcomes:</span></p><ol><li><strong><span>Clarification of the Funding Source of Ekuri Community Forest</span></strong></li></ol><p><span>The following questions needs to be answered clearly and transparently: where are the funds for the Ekuri Superhighway coming from, what are the conditions attached to the funds and what are the implications for the economic autonomy of the community and state?</span></p><ol><li><strong><span>Community Sensitization, Mobilization and Empowerment</span></strong></li></ol><p><span>Any successful community effort will require proper sensitization, mobilization and empowerment. The entry protocol will include identification of the power structures in the community, individually sensitize the opinion leaders, organize collective community dialogues and connect the community with resources to exercise their human rights provided according to the law. This will enable the community negotiate appropriate compensations, where necessary. </span></p><ol><li><strong><span>Land Belongs to the People</span></strong></li></ol><p><span>A key bone of contention in environmental issues comes about from the lack of clarity (or wrong awareness) of the ownership of land. It was brought to light that land belongs to the people, according to combined interpretation of the Land Use Act as well as the Constitution of Nigeria. The government is a ‘keeper’ of the land and cannot carry out activities that will infringe on the rights of the people, without their consent. </span></p><ol><li><strong><span>Regard for the Forest</span></strong></li></ol><p><span>The forest is more than a collection of trees. The town hall meeting resolved to demand a holistic regard for the forest and the intricate values it provides ecologically, socio-culturally, and economically. A plantation of trees cannot be used to replace a forest and the dependent communities that have existed for hundred of generations.<span>  </span></span></p><ol><li><strong><span>The Super Highway is Unlawful and Unwanted</span></strong></li></ol><p><span>The community representative expressed severally that while they are in need of good roads to serve their needs, they require a repair / upgrade of the currently existing road which was abandoned by the previous government, instead of an unjustifiable ‘Super Highway.’</span></p><ol><li><strong><span>Sustained peaceful protests and campaigns</span></strong></li></ol><p><span>HOMEF and all its partners belief solely in peaceful methods to creating<span>  </span>change, including the use of all forms of media. Sustained protest and campaigns will continue to create the pressure required for the government to pay attention to the needs, voices and rights of stakeholder communities. </span></p><ol><li><strong><span>Community Organizing</span></strong></li></ol><p><span>When there is a desecration of the environment, several communities suffer the impact. It is imperative for communities to come together, work in solidarity and ensure that they combine efforts to get their voices heard. </span></p><p><span>---------</span></p><p><span>Welcome words by Nnimmo Bassey at the Forest Town Hall:</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><strong><span>What Nature Has Connected</span></strong></p><p class=\"p1\"><span>The theme of this year’s World Environment Day, <strong><em>Connecting People to Nature</em></strong>, could not have been more apt, considering that humankind has lost the vital connections that make us conscious of our being a part of a community of beings on Earth.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span>Today we want to particularly look at the disruption of that connection by the politics of infrastructure that is sometimes pursued without recourse to national or even natural laws. We see roads build without drainages and where they are constructed, they are invariably emptied into streams and rivers without any consideration of the wellbeing of the aquatic life in them and of the people that depend on the water downstream.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span>I once asked the manager of a phosphate factory dumping toxic effluent into the Atlantic Ocean at Kpeme, near Lome, why such a harmful practice was permitted. The answer was that &#34;you cannot make an omelette without breaking the egg.&#34; If you ask why international oil companies have been routinely flaring gas in the Niger Delta over the past fifty-nine years, they claim it became &#34;industry practice&#34; because there was no market for the product when oil extraction commenced. Can you seen how low we can sink?</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span>One of the infrastructural projects that has astonished the world and stunned local communities is the 260 km Superhighway proposed by the Cross River State Government (CRSG) to originate from a “deep sea” port at Esighi in Cross River State and rip through the National Park and community forests to terminate at Katsina Ala in Benue State. <span> </span>This Town Hall meeting will examine what has been lost due to the commencement of the execution of the project without adequate public consultations, before an approved Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) and presumably before any detailed site-specific designs had been made. We will also examine what has been saved by the self-reversal of the order by which the CRSG had grabbed an amazing 10km span of land on either side of the proposed highway. That land uptake would have meant the displacement of several communities, conversion of pristine forests, decimation of wildlife and possibly the extinction of some species. </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span>The idea of shaving pristine and protected forests for the installation of a highway of any form indicates a clear disconnection between people and Nature. The farcical community consultations so far carried out underscores the disconnection between the wielders of power and the citizens. The struggle waged by the communities to ensure that they are duly consulted and that their free prior informed consent is obtained before any project execution is an indication that a people connected to Nature would not readily allow any force to disconnect them from Nature on which they depend for livelihoods. This Town Hall will also seek to assure our threatened communities that we are united in the efforts to ensure that they are allowed to live in dignity, enhance their systems of knowledge and that the best interest of all beings is respected.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span>The forest dependent communities of Cross River State have shown exemplary commitment to protecting and managing their community forests. In attestation of their excellent performance, the Ekuri people were conferred with the Equator Prize by the United Nations Development Programme in 2004. Forests provide a variety of services to humans and other beings. Forests help to cool the Earth, protect our rivers, maintain soil quality, house wildlife. They provide food and medicine for humans and are home to pollinators. While the communities deserve to have good access roads, building any superhighway through the well managed forests would spell disaster of global implications.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span>Regrettably, Nature has become to many of us &#34;a thing&#34; that is to be appropriated, transformed and traded. We have gone so far from Nature that one sounds ridiculous to insist that we do not need to attach monetary values to Nature before we can protect her. This is the logic that undergirds the concept of Green Economy and promotes market environmentalism. We have forgotten the intrinsic values of the gifts of Nature and of Nature herself. We believe that all is not lost. We can wake up from the present nightmare and dream of better ways of living, of connecting with Mother Earth. </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span>Today, we have deliberated chosen to mark the World Environment Day by having a Forest Town Hall Meeting. We note that parts of our nation are not being denuded by processes of desertification and the forest regions are rapidly becoming Sahellian.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\">  </span>The transformation cannot be blamed on climate change alone, although it does play a part in the area of desertification. Our disconnection from Nature has permitted us to clear our forests, destroy complex ecosystems, food systems and our social heritage without any reflections on the consequences of our actions. The loss of our forest ecosystems translates to the loss of culture, of ways of life, of possibly irredeemable destruction of species. These loses translate to direct deprivation of livelihoods and the exacerbation of poverty in our forest dependent communities.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span>We are pleased that the Federal Ministry of Environment has stood ready to review Environment Impact Assessment documents presented by the CRSG and that a nod would only be given when it is clear that all requirements of the law are met, including full consultation of the communities that would be impacted by the proposed project. We look forward to hearing thoughts and experiences from development and environmental experts as well as from representatives of communities threatened by the proposed that project.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span>I and my colleagues took part in an ecological community dialogue in Akpabuyo, one of the already impacted communities, last week. The lament of the people that still rings in my ear is this: &#34;We were not consulted before the superhighway was routed through our communities. We just saw bulldozers mowing down our trees, crops and properties. We insist that we must be consulted and that our consent must be obtained and due compensations paid for what has been destroyed and before any further work here. Our livelihoods depend on our environment. We cannot be treated like slaves in our own land.&#34;</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span> What was implied is that we must not be disconnected from our land, from Mother Earth. In other words, what Nature has connected, let no person or government put asunder. </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p>','Health of Mother Earth Foundation held a Forest Town Hall Meeting on Monday – June 5, 2017 in commemoration of World Environment Day, at Apo Apartments in Abuja.

The citizens also called for a total ban on GMOs in Nigeria or at best restrict them to the confines of laboratories of research institutions.</span></p><p><span>The people insisted that Nigeria&#39;s food challenges can be tackled effectively with natural crops and increaswd support for our farmers rather than opening arms wide for a technology that has notoriously failed and proven to pose severe risk to  human, animal and environmental health is far from the solution. <br></span></p><p><span>According to the Director of Health of Mother Earth Foundation, “GMOs do not give greater yield and are not more nutritious than natural crops. They have increased the use of toxic chemicals and thrive in monocultures while they deprive farmers the right to save and re-use seeds.”</span></p><p><span><span>The response of the leadership of the Nigerian Biosafety Management Agency (NBMA), has remained consistent, tending to allay fears rather than dealing with the concerns of the public. Their position that Nigeria will regulate the use of GMOs <a href=\"http://www.environewsnigeria.com/gmos-well-regulate-biosafety-sector-based-science-not-sentiments-ebegba/\">based on science and not sentiments</a> does not in any measure respond to the known negative impacts of GMOs. We believe that sentiments cannot be wioshed away. We are human and not laboratory rats. The science of GMOs must consider its ethical, moral, cultural, soci-economic and other ramifications. Science itself has shown that it is limited in its very own processes. It must be in the public interest. As was explained by a Molecular geneticist, Dr Ify Aniebo, in a recent lecture at an HOMEF event, scientists do not have total control of the direction of the new genes which are introduced into plants’ DNA. The normal functioning of cells gets impaired and several novel proteins are produced which cause severe health complications. This is one reason for the increase of chronic and other diseases since the introduction of this technology. Apart from allergies, birth defects, liver diseases, neurological and gastrointestinal disorders, the processes can result to mutation which is one of the long term impacts of this technology. Glyphosate, an active ingredient of Monsanto’s Roundup chemical which accompanies the use of GMOs was announced to be carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the</span><span> <a href=\"http://www.i-sis.org.uk/Glyphosate_Probably_Carcinogenic_to_Humans.php\"><span>World Health Organization</span></a></span><span> in March 2015. Despite strong denials by the biotech industry, the harms posed by this toxic chemicals cannot be wished away.<br></span></span></p><p><span>Supporters of this technology in Nigeria keep saying that other countries have taken to genetic engineering and Nigeria must not be left out. Nigerians are perplexed by this cheap position. They ask: Are we seriously going into a potentially deadly technology because other countries are using it? Do we have the capacity to contain the impact of these crops on our health and the environment? Have we stopped to ask why there is yet so much controversy over this technology since its introduction and why 6 out of the 8 industrialised countries, (G8) have banned the cultivation of GMOs?  </span></p><p><span><span>GMOs do not only present threat to human health and the environment; the Nigerian economy is also at stake on this issue. A large percentage of our agricultural exports are to the European Union. However, we will recall that </span><span><a><span>they rejected 24 of our food products in 2016.</span></a></span><span> The European Union food safety authority had likewise rejected beans from Nigeria in 2015 because it contained between 0.03mg/kg and 4.6mg/kg of dichlorvos pesticide when the acceptable maximum level was 0.01mg/kg. At least 19 EU countries already have a ban on GMO products. If Nigeria accepts GMOs we would lose any trade edge with many countries.<br></span></span></p><p><span>A patriotic approach to the food challenge in Nigeria will be to engage in rigorous and independent research to certify the safety of GM seeds in terms of short and long term impacts on humans and the environment; to consult with the people, especially the farmers, to know how best to support them to improve agricultural productivity and to make decisions based on proven facts in resonance with the culture and needs of the indigenous people. </span></p><p><span>Other actions that can address our food needs include, increased support for organic farming, access of farmers to loans and grants, provision of extension services, storage and processing facilities and good infrstructure to ensure access markets.<br></span></p><p><span><span>The letter submitted to the Senate President which was jointly signed by Nnimmo Bassey, the Director at Health of Mother Earth Foundation; Mariann Orvwuje,</span><span> coordinator of Friends of the Earth Africa’s Food Sovereignty Programme (FSP)</span><span>; Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour, </span><span>Convener of Nigerians against GMOs and </span><span>Jackie Ikotuonye, Country Representative, Bio-integrity and Natural Food Awareness Initiative stated that a repeal of the Nigeria Biosafety Management Act will resolve the biosafety challenges facing the nation.</span></span></p><p><span><span>The letter also characterised the  Act as having failed in its duty to</span><span> secure our biosafety because it has proven within a few months of its ceation to be a law merely for permitting the entry into Nigeria of GMOs.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Several issues need to be addressed and these include the composition of the board of the Regulatory Agency.

It does not ensure the implementation of the precautionary principle (essential feature of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (CPB)) that entitles our government to decide against approval or for restriction in cases of incomplete or controversial knowledge and does not have provisions for strict liability and redress. NBMA keeps telling Nigerians that the mere fact of having a biosafety Act is an adherence to the <a href=\"http://genok.no/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Chapter-30.pdf\">Precautionary Principle</a>. In terms of labelling, we all know that mere labeling of GMOs will not work in our context as road-side food sellers would not label the corn they roast or the <em>akara</em> (bean cake) that they fry. The need to consider our peculiar contxt cannot be ignored.</span></p><p><span>The coalition made the following demands on the government:</span> </p><ol><li><span>A nullification of the permits issued to Monsanto and NABDA on Sunday 1st May 2016 and call for an investigation of the process and circumstances leading to the granting of these permits by NBMA to Monsanto and NABDA in disregard to the complaints of millions of Nigerians. Nigerians should not be used as pawns or as guinea pigs in a commercial gambit to open the country to toxic technologies in furtherance of blatant commercial interests. </span></li><li><span>A close surveillance of our markets and farms to halt illegal entry of GMOs into Nigeria and into our food supply. </span></li><li><span>A ban of all toxic agrochemicals – especially those identified as probably carcinogens. </span></li><li><span>A halt to the assault on our agriculture through genetic modification of our staple crops including cassava, maize and beans, among others.

Change can begin from below. True change must come from below. Just as it is the root system that makes a tree stand, so it is with changes that must last. We have ignored the roots of our problems long enough and today we are dissecting those roots so that we can clearly see where the proverbial rain began to beat us.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Along the 853km coastline of Nigeria are men and women floating in turbulent tides, seeking to draw out the swirling foods that are in turn seeking their own food. <span> </span>There are epic struggles on and in our waters: our fishing brothers, sisters, mothers and fathers struggle to catch the aquatic beings. The aquatic beings struggle not just to escape the nets and hooks, but also to catch a breath as they are suffocated by myriad pollutants and poisons. These realities extend along the coasts of our inland water bodies as well as the continental shorelines of Africa and around the world. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>And, so, our stop today is for reflections on the health of our aquatic ecosystems and the challenge of offshore extractive activities and the economic situation of our peoples. Similar dialogues have commenced in South Africa where fisher folks are fighting for a right to fish on the piers of the Durban harbour without restrictions that blocks them away known fishing grounds. We have also had similar conversations at Kribi, Cameroun, where the entrance of the Chad-Cameroun pipeline has destroyed coral reefs and fisher folks have to go deeper into the seas in hope of having a meaningful catch. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>As we gather today on this challenged Water Front in Port Harcourt, our FishNet Dialogue will examine the past and the present and draw up a picture of our preferred future. We are looking back at what the fishing situation was in the Niger Delta before the extraction of petroleum resources despoiled the marine environment. We are reflecting on what species were available and what ecological norms our ancestors applied to ensure a steady supply of nutritious foods and how they built the local economies. We are looking at what has happened since our territories became an industrial waste dump, where mangroves have been destroyed by many factors and where fishing grounds have been largely curtailed by military shields ringing oil and gas facilities. We will touch on the rising sea levels, eroding coastlines and the salinization of our fresh water systems. Importantly, we are reflecting on who are the culprits and what must be done and how.</span></p><p><span>Our hope is that, as we sit in this and other FishNet Dialogues, we will extend hands to other fishing communities along the entire coast of Africa (and beyond), share our stories and underscore the facts of our common humanity, our right to food and our right to live in dignity. We look forward to the day when it will dawn on all that fish is more valuable than oil. We are looking forward to the day when our voices will echo <em>Fish Not Oil</em> on our simmering tides. We are looking forward to the day when change will truly come from below and climate action will finally have as a pivotal hook the reality that offshore fossil fuels must be left untapped and unburned.</span></p><p><span>Fisheries contribute substantially to local economies and are a vital source of protein for most of our peoples. It is estimated that fisheries contribute up to N126 billion to Nigeria’s economy annually. Sadly, only about 30 percent of our fish needs are produced locally – and these come from artisanal, aquaculture and industrial fisheries. In the Niger Delta, it is a worrisome truth that many fisher folks have become fetchers of wood as the creeks and rivers have been so polluted that fishing has become largely unproductive. Fishing communities have been forced to depend on imported fish by pollution and by reckless and illegal harvesting of fish by foreign trawlers along our continental shelf. Starkly, some analyst believe that the Nigeria is the highest importer of fish in Africa.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>It is time to challenge our policy makers to interrogate the essence of development and determine what truly makes economic sense. The offshore extractive sector employs a handful of citizens, but throws millions out of work due to the taking over of fishing grounds and the pollution of the creeks, rivers and seas. Although GDP measures do not put food on dining table or is not an index of well-being, for a notion of the economic implication, we consider the case of Ghana. </span><span>As at 2011, the fishery industry accounted for nearly 5 percent of Ghana’s GDP and jobs in the offshore oil industry for Ghanaians were estimated to be around 400 with an expectation that this may double by 2020. Meanwhile, fishing directly or indirectly supported up to 10 percent of the country’s population. Think about that.</span></p><p><span>We must consider the grave impacts on the global climate by the world’s continued dependence on fossil fuels – an addiction that permits extreme extraction and the poking around for deposits in the deep sea. We question the economic sense of investing huge sums of money to set up drilling platforms and Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) stations in stormy, dangerous waters.</span></p><p><span>Offshore oil production involves environmental risks, the most notable one being </span><span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_spill\" title=\"Oil spill\"><span>oil spills</span></a></span><span> from oil tankers or pipelines, and from leaks and accidents including facilities failure on the platform.<span>  </span>The materials used in the process of drilling are also a source for worry. We cite the example of drilling muds used for the lubrication and cooling of the drill bits and pipes. The drilling muds release toxic chemicals that affect marine life. One drilling platform can drill several wells and discharge more than 90,000 metric tons of drilling fluids and metal cuttings into the ocean. </span></p><p><span>We also have to consider <em>produced water</em>, a fluid brought up with oil and gas and making up about 20 percent of the waste associated with offshore drilling. At exploratory stages, seismic activities send a strong shock waves across the seabed that can decrease fish catch, damage the hearing capacity of various marine species and lead to marine mammal stranding. Many dead whales washed onshore in Ghana at the time seismic and oil drilling activities peaked in that country’s offshore. We also had similar experiences during offshore accidents, such as the Chevron rig explosion off the coast of Bayelsa State in January 2012.</span></p><p><span>Offshore oil rigs also attract seabirds at night due to their lighting and flaring and because fish aggregate near them. The attraction of fish to the rigs deprive fisher folks of access due to the naval cordon around the facilities. The process of flaring involves the burning off of fossil fuels which produces black carbon (a current menace around Port Harcourt) and constitute a source of greenhouse gases that compound the global warming crisis.</span></p><p><span>Fishery on the other hand has little or no negative externality on the people or environment. It is a source of food and food security as well. It is a source of job creation. And it does not harm the climate. Offshore extraction and its externalities point towards negative indicators and are prime sources of conflicts between nations. Our FishNet Dialogues aim to build local economies, fight global warming at the base and build a movement from below to ensure a liveable planet, support local economies and build peace.</span></p><p><span>Let the dialogue continue.</span></p><p><span>--------------------  </span><strong><span> </span></strong><span>     </span></p><p><em><span>Welcome words by Nnimmo Bassey, Director Health of Mother Earth Foundation, at the<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span><strong>FishNet Dialogue</strong><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>held at Port Harcourt on 7 July 2017</span></em></p><p><span> </span></p>','','article',1499444906,1499445073),(199,'Catholic Doctors Caution on GMOs','<p><span>The Association of Catholic Medical Precatitioners of Nigeria urged Nigeria to observe the Precautionary Principle at a scientific conference it held July 6-8, 2017 in Port Harcourt.

It was made possible by the local fishers and with the facilitation of <em>Association Jeune Chretien en Action pour le Developpement</em> (JCAD). The epochal event took place at <em>Centre d’Education Spirituelle pour l’Apostolat des Laics</em> (CESAL). Togo now joins Nigeria, Cameroon, Nigeria and South Africa as countries where FishNet Alliance has members.</p><p>At the event, Ahianyo Kokou Guy, the chairman of the Board of JCAD stated that the gathering was called to mobilize fishers who have been impacted by oil exploration/extraction as well as from impacts of climate change. It was also to develop resilience strategies to climate change to help protect their livelihoods. He was optimistic that the sharing of oil impact experiences from Ghana and Nigeria would set the stage for the inauguration of the FishNet Alliance in Togo.</p><p><strong>Steady Growth of the Fishing Sector in Togo</strong></p><p>First presentation was on Fisheries and the Impacts of Climate Change by the leader of the fishers group<strong>, </strong>Mr Dermane Adam. He stated that fishing in Togo is mostly artisanal and that there are a total of 22,000 fishers - 12,000 of which are women while 10,000 are men. Their current fishing harbour at Ablogame, Lome, is giving way to an expanding container port while a new one is being constructed by the government with support from the Japanese government.</p><p>The sector was mostly dominated by fishermen and women from Ghana and other countries until the 1980s when then president Eyadema decided to promote the sector in order to have more Togolese in the trade. Fishers in Togo became better organised from the 1990s, this made the government pay more attention to the sector.</p><p>&#34;I come from Northern Togo, and many wonder how I became a fisherman here. I became a professional fisherman in the 1980s when then president showed interest in developing the sector and getting more Togolese involved, &#34; said Adam.  </p><p>Today they have fishing schools and the sector is gradually getting more mechanised with the introduction of newer fishing techniques.</p><p><strong>Challenges</strong></p><p>Fishers have to go further offshore to increase the chance of making a good catch. This would require the acquisition of bigger boats which are purchased in Ghana at the cost of $1400 each. </p><p>&#34;After buying the boat you have to buy the outboard engines imported from Japan and sometimes from China. One engine costs over $4000&#34;, Adam added. &#34;Besides the purchase of the boat and an engine, one still need to buy the nets at about same price as the engine. It is an expensive business and the possibility of getting financial support from the banks is very slim&#34;, he said.</p><p>Adam is worried that petroleum exploration and extraction activities in Togolese waters will harm the marine ecosystems and compound the challenges facing the fishers. He noted that fish are migrating away from noisy coastlines and from pollution from oil spills and waste oils.</p><p>Adam was hopeful that with the formation of the FishNet Alliance, the fishers would have information about activities in other countries and also have a wider space for sharing experiences.</p><p><strong>Oil and Gas eroding the identity of the Fisheries Sector</strong></p><p>Noble Wadzah of Oilwatch Ghana spoke on the subject ‘<strong>The Fisheries Sector: A Lost identity in the Scheme of Oil and Gas’. </strong>His presentation covered the key features of Revenue Management Act of Ghana, highlighting the big failures and gaps in its formulation and with regards to the fisheries sector. He also focused on how fisheries sector is perceived in official circles in Ghana.</p><p>Oil business picked up with the discovery of the resource in Ghana in 2008. Politicians and bureaucrats were very happy. The citizens got drawn into the euphoria - all believing that a lot of funds would come into the system and citizens would enter an era of prosperity.</p><p>Ghana started with thinking about how to manage oil revenue before thinking of any Oil and Gas Policy and then harmonizing the Exploration and Production Law. Wadzah saw this as a fatal flaw in the approach to the oil and gas business. He then detailed the tripod on which the Act stands as follows:</p><p>1.     Support national budget</p><p>2.     Assign funds for future generations</p><p>3.     Stabilize economy when there are shocks</p><p>His brisk presentation went on to list the following:</p><p> ·       10% (2.5 million) of the Ghanaian population engage in fisheries. Double that number for others that depend on those directly involved in fishing.</p><p>·       Oil contributes 1.2 Million USD annually to the Ghanaian economy.</p><p>·       Interestingly, it is the same amount that fisheries brought to the economy that was the expected revenue to be brought in by oil at that time.</p><p>·       Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) prepared by oil companies claimed that fisheries would not be impacted by oil activities.</p><p>·       In order to fast track oil exploitation, government ignored the requirements in existing laws that required <strong>fisheries impact assessment</strong> before any extractive activities are permitted in the seas.</p><p>·       A commission to manage the oil did not include any representatives from the fisheries sector.</p><p>·       Fishers are now resisting oil activities in their waters due to unmet expectations and these have led to conflicts and arrests of some locals.</p><p>·       Government is now beginning to think about how to build harmony between oil exploitation and fisheries through a <strong>Sea Safe Framework</strong>.</p><p>Wadzah rounded up his presentation by highlighting that 10 years of oil extraction, no benefits have trickled down to the local fishers and it has become clear that rather than expecting gains they are in for more loses.</p><p>He recommended that as a way forward, oil and gas business must not dominate or destroy fisheries business. He noted that fisheries are renewable whereas oil is not and that whereas fisheries support citizen&#39;s economy, oil does not. He also stated that the FishNet Alliance demands that investments must shift away fossil energy and into renewables. The Alliance also believes that fisheries holds the key to economic progress and nutrition for Africa.</p><p><strong>Fish Not Oil</strong></p><p>Nnimmo Bassey brought a report from Nigeria and this elicited interest from participants who wanted to know what the clean-up situation was in the Niger Delta after six decades of oil and gas extraction. What is the fate of the 6.5 million fishers in Nigeria?  Participants learned that the clean-up process of the Niger Delta is commencing with Ogoni territory and that according to a report prepared by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), it would take a generation (30 years) to complete the clean-up and restoration of that environment.</p><p>The general situation of oil and gas exploration in inland water bodies as well as along the entire continental coastline was examined with the potential for political conflicts between nations – due to the resources being found along national boundaries- as well as the impending oil spills and other polluting activities. Pollution of ground water was highlighted as problematic in South Sudan and Nigeria.</p><p>The damage to fisheries was emphasized and the fact that fishers have already started campaigns against extractive activities in Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon and South Africa was underscored. Of interest was the fact that some countries have already legislated against extraction of petroleum resources in their waters. Examples were given of Costa Rica and Belize. It also mentioned that El Salvador has banned mining in order to protect nature’s gifts in that nation.</p><p><strong>FishNet Alliance expands</strong></p><p>At the end of deliberations, the FishNet Alliance Togo was formally inaugurated by Nnimmo Bassey. He stressed that the Alliance was a platform for solidarity, connecting of struggles and support for livelihoods.</p><p>Mr Adam declared that “united we are strong”. He also added that the Alliance will embolden the fishers in Togo to take strong positions, make strong demands for the protection of marine ecosystems. He added, “we are ready to share information and to participate in activities of the network”.</p><p> </p><p>    </p><p> </p>','','article',1520349687,1520542275),(214,'Living in Fear','','','publication',1521022236,1521022433),(215,'Nigeria-Morocco gas pipeline: Not in Our Interest','<p><strong><span class=\"ydpbbac1fa5MsoHyperlink\">Nigeria-Morocco gas pipeline: Not in Our Interest</span></strong></p><p><span class=\"ydpbbac1fa5MsoHyperlink\">In December 2016, an announcement was made of a nearly 5000 km Nigeria-Morocco offshore gas pipeline which at today’s prices will cost an estimated 20 billion US dollars. In reality, the actual costs will likely be much higher. This pipeline would be a continuation of the existing 678 km long West African Gas pipeline (WAGP) that has been in service since 2010. It aims to serve 12 countries on the African continent and some 300 million potential consumers, with a possible extension to the Europe.</span></p><p><span class=\"ydpbbac1fa5MsoHyperlink\">We, the undersigned organizations, are concerned about this project for several reasons, including:</span></p><p><span class=\"ydpbbac1fa5MsoHyperlink\">1. While the acceleration of global warming exceeds all expectations and greenhouse gas emissions have set a new record in 2016, the construction of this pipeline can only go in the direction of an increase of extraction and consumption of fossil resources, the main causes of global warming.</span></p><p><span class=\"ydpbbac1fa5MsoHyperlink\">2. Contrary to what is often asserted, gas is not clean energy.  The methane in it is more volatile than CO2, and much more powerful in global warming potential<a name=\"_ftnref1\"><span class=\"ydpbbac1fa5MsoHyperlink\"><span class=\"ydpbbac1fa5MsoHyperlink\">[1]</span></span></a>. Moreover, the concentration of methane in the atmosphere has accelerated dangerously since 2007.</span></p><p><span class=\"ydpbbac1fa5MsoHyperlink\">3. The extraction, transportation and use of fossil fuels has considerable environmental implications: the disturbing effects of seismic studies on marine fauna, the use and release of various chemical substances and wastes, the risks of leaks, fires and explosions related to corrosion and navigation are additional risks to that of methane emissions. This will destroy livelihoods of millions of our people depending on fisheries in our regional waters.</span></p><p><span class=\"ydpbbac1fa5MsoHyperlink\">4. The section already constructed (WAGP) was done without consulting the populations who rejected the environmental impact study.</span></p><p><span class=\"ydpbbac1fa5MsoHyperlink\">5. It is a top-down project that does not consider the needs of the populations and the environment. They are not consulted and will not be the first beneficiaries of this pipeline. While Nigeria is Africa&#39;s largest exporter of gas and oil, less than half of the population has access to electricity. In Benin, Togo, already served by the WAGP, barely a third of the population have access to electricity.</span></p><p><span class=\"ydpbbac1fa5MsoHyperlink\">6. The proposed pipeline is a project for the multinational corporations. Nigerians do not benefit from Oil exploitation in Nigeria. </span></p><p><span class=\"ydpbbac1fa5MsoHyperlink\">7. The energy produced will be used primarily to fuel agribusiness projects and export-oriented industrial clusters at the expense of small farmers and artisans and the satisfaction of the needs of the people.</span></p><p><span class=\"ydpbbac1fa5MsoHyperlink\">8. This project will be a financial sinkhole. It is likely that the forecast cost of US $ 20 billion will be probably doubled and will lead to an exponential increase of the debt burden of our countries.</span></p><p><span class=\"ydpbbac1fa5MsoHyperlink\">We the undersigned believe that the proposed Nigeria-Morocco gas pipeline is bad for the region, our peoples and the Planet. We say NO to the project,</span></p><p><span class=\"ydpbbac1fa5MsoHyperlink\">Because we choose the climate in place of fossil energy,</span></p><p><span class=\"ydpbbac1fa5MsoHyperlink\">Because we choose the health of our planet against the appetites of multinationals,</span></p><p><span class=\"ydpbbac1fa5MsoHyperlink\">Because we refuse to pay for projects that will not bring us anything,</span></p><p><span class=\"ydpbbac1fa5MsoHyperlink\">We say no to the Nigeria-Morocco pipeline.</span></p><p><strong><span class=\"ydpbbac1fa5MsoHyperlink\"> </span></strong></p><p><span

The fact that President Muhammadu Buhari just inaugurated a Food Security Council underscores the centrality of food security to the country. However, without food safety there cannot be food security.</span></p><p><span>On the 22nd of March, 2018, the country coordinator for Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology (OFAB) <span>and National Biotechnology Development Agency (NABDA) chieftain, </span>Dr Rose Gidado, stated in an interview</span><a name=\"_ednref1\" href=\"#_edn1\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span><span><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span>[1]</span></span></span></span></span></a><span> with newsmen in Abuja that “<em>before the end of 2018, Bt Cowpea and Bt Cotton as biotechnology products in Nigeria would be in market</em>.” </span></p><p><span>Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF) raised concerns with regard to this announcement and stated that these products are soon to be unleashed on an unsuspecting Nigerian public. According to the organisation, there is no guarantee about the environmental and health safety of the beans and cotton to be released by the end of 2018. </span></p><p><span>Nnimmo Bassey, the Director of HOMEF stressed that there are <span>serious challenges</span></span><a name=\"_ednref2\" href=\"#_edn2\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span><span><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span>[2]</span></span></span></span></span></a><span> GMOs pose in the areas of toxicology, allergy and immune dysfunction and genetic disorders which make it very important that Nigeria adopts the precautionary principle-which warns that </span><span>strict measures should be applied where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage and lack of full scientific certainty </span></p><p><span>The OFAB/NABDA officer stated that “<em>the pesticide tolerant cowpea will allow for a reduced use of pesticide</em>”. To this, Nnimmo Bassey, responded and stated it is well known that pests have developed resistance</span><a name=\"_ednref3\" href=\"#_edn3\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span><span><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span>[3]</span></span></span></span></span></a><span> to the Bt toxins and this resistance leads to an increased use of toxic chemicals which increases the damage to the environment. </span></p><p><span>According to Mariann Orovwuje, the African Food Sovereignty Alliance (AFSA) chairperson, “Bt crops and other GM foods will not help Nigeria’s economy as the supporters of the technology allege. Rather, there will be forced dependence on corporate bodies for seeds. Farmers will have no right to reuse their seeds and agricultural production will be left in the hands of large scale industrial investors.” </span></p><p><span>The National Food, Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) in June 2017 revealed that 24 export products from Nigeria were rejected by the European Union</span><a name=\"_ednref4\" href=\"#_edn4\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span><span><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span>[4]</span></span></span></span></span></a><span> (EU) in the year 2016 for failing to meet standards. HOMEF warns that the market for genetically modified products from Nigeria is narrowing instead of expanding, with the strict requirement of the EU. </span></p><p><span>HOMEF believes that the way to improve economic situation for farmers is to invest in organic agriculture, provide farmers with extension services, needed infrastructure, good roads and access to land and loans. Support for farmers should include investment in research and exploration of agroecology approach to the problems of pests and diseases.</span></p><p><span>The organisation stated that it is good to learn from others who have taken caution against GMOs. “The Ugandan President, Yoweri Museveni had declined to sign into law a Biosafety Bill passed by the Ugandan Parliament in October 2017 because of issues that included liability and redress and concerns on conservation of indigenous crops and agricultural biodiversity.”</span></p><p><span>According to Joyce Ebebeinwe, Biosafety Officer at HOMEF, the Director of the National Biosafety Management Agency (NBMA) during a recent twitter chat was asked how the <em>akara</em> or <em>moi-moi</em> made from GM beans and other foods sold by the road sides will be labelled and his response was that the sellers should erect signposts announcing that they are selling GM <span>products</span>. That would be laughable if not for the fact that it is an extremely tragic notion. </span></p><p><span>HOMEF insisted that the promise to have GMOs labelled in Nigeria to ensure that the public have a choice on whether or not to eat such crops will not work mainly due to our socio-cultural and economic realities. </span></p><p><span>Furthermore, the recent statement by the NBMA DG, Dr Rufus Ebegba, at a media conference in Abuja on the 5th of April shows clearly how flawed our biosafety regulatory system is. According to reports</span><a name=\"_ednref5\" href=\"#_edn5\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span><span><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span>[5]</span></span></span></span></span></a><span>, “<em>Dr. Rufus Ebegba, has given importers of genetically modified (GM) seeds a seven-day ultimatum to formalise their dealings or risk being shut down</em>”. </span></p><p><span>HOMEF expressed that this statement is in direct contrast to the provisions of the law. <strong><span>Section 23 (1) of the NBMA Act 2015 </span></strong><span>states: “<em>Any person, institution or body who wishes to import, export, transit or otherwise carry out a contained field trial, multi-locational trial or commercial release of a genetically modified organism shall apply to the Director General of the Agency <strong><span>not less than 270 days to the date of import, export, transit or the commencement of such activity”.</span></strong></em></span></span></p><p><span>According to HOMEF, the statement by the NBMA DG may be construed to mean that dealers on GM products in Nigeria will be given permits after they had imported GMO seeds without passing through due approval processes. HOMEF totally objects to any sort of formalisation of illegal importation of GMOs into the country. A short notice to import these crops does not allow for risk assessments or safety assurances and regrettably this may have been the basis on which the agency granted WACOT Ltd permits to import several varieties of GM maize over a period of three years – after the company was alleged to have illegally brought in the crop in September 2017 and had been ordered to repatriate the grains.</span></p><p><span>The Ecological Think Tank calls on the Nigerian government to look critically at the activities of the Nigerian Biosafety Regulatory Agency and the subject of genetically modified foods in the country. While HOMEF commends the action of the federal government in establishing the food security council, the group insists that it is pertinent that action is taken to ensure that our foods are indeed safe.<span>  </span></span></p><p> </p><p>Notes</p><div><hr><div id=\"edn1\"><p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><a name=\"_edn1\" href=\"#_ednref1\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span>[1]</span></span></span></span></a> Vanguard News: <a href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/03/nigeria-use-biotechnology-improve-crops/\">https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/03/nigeria-use-biotechnology-improve-crops/</a></p></div><div id=\"edn2\"><p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><a name=\"_edn2\" href=\"#_ednref2\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span>[2]</span></span></span></span></a> <span>Science in Society Archive: </span><a href=\"http://www.i-sis.org.uk/TheCaseforAGM-FreeSustainableWorld.php\"><span>www.i-sis.org.uk/TheCaseforAGM-FreeSustainableWorld.php</span></a></p></div><div id=\"edn3\"><p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><a name=\"_edn3\" href=\"#_ednref3\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span>[3]</span></span></span></span></a> PLOS Research Journal: <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0022629\">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0022629</a></p></div><div id=\"edn4\"><p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><a name=\"_edn4\" href=\"#_ednref4\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span>[4]</span></span></span></span></a>Vanguard News: <a href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/06/nafdac-says-eu-rejected-24-nigeria-exported-products-2016/\">https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/06/nafdac-says-eu-rejected-24-nigeria-exported-products-2016/</a><span>  </span></p></div><div id=\"edn5\"><p class=\"MsoEndnoteText\"><a name=\"_edn5\" href=\"#_ednref5\"><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><span>[5]</span></span></span></span></a> EnviroNews Nigeria: <a href=\"http://www.environewsnigeria.com/gm-seeds-importers-given-seven-day-ultimatum-to-formalise-dealings/\">www.environewsnigeria.com/gm-seeds-importers-given-seven-day-ultimatum-to-formalise-dealings/</a></p></div></div><p> </p><p> </p>','While Nigerians face uncertainties over food security due to incessant herders-farmers clashes, another threat is dawning on the nation without much notice.

The Dialogue encouraged parties to speak freely to each other on three questions about the global climate crisis: Where are we? Where do we want to go? How do we get there?

And they are both wrong.</span></p><p><span>Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF) however differs with both on the view that agricultural biotechnology will end world hunger. Many individuals and Civil Society Organisations including the Association of Catholic Medical Practitioners of Nigeria (ACMPN) have warned against the use of this technology in Nigeria.</span></p><p><span>According to news reports on 24th May 2018, the former President at the South-West Sensitisation programme of the Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology (OFAB) canvassed the adoption of biotechnology in agriculture to end hunger across the world.</span></p><p><span>HOMEF responding in a statement asserts that agricultural biotechnology does not address the issue of hunger and it is not the solution to agricultural problems in the world. </span></p><p><span>“Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) which are the products of this technology are not designed to feed people but mostly to feed animals, machines and<span>  </span>the financial appetites of their producers and <span> </span>their partners” said Nnimmo Bassey, HOMEF’s Director.</span> </p><p><span>He stated, “That more land will not have to be cultivated to meet increasing food demands and that what is needed is a reduction in food waste which now amounts to about 1.3 billion tons per year. One third of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted globally and translates into roughly US$ 680 billion in industrialized countries and US$ 310 billion in developing countries”.</span></p><p><span>“The world already produces enough food for over 9 billion people which is the population peak we expect by 2050. Thus the challenge of hunger is not for lack of food but of lack of access to food. It is a problem of poverty, inequality and wastage”.</span></p><p><span>“GMOs compound economic, health, and environmental problems instead of alleviating them. Majority of the genetically engineered crops are produced to withstand the use of herbicides or to act as pesticides themselves. Apart from the fact that these chemicals are expensive, they are highly toxic and destroy beneficial organisms in the soil. Studies have shown the development of super weeds and super pests which are resistant to these chemicals and the result is an increased dependence on chemical inputs and more environmental challenges”.</span></p><p><span>“That GMOs bring about increased productivity is nothing but an industry-promoted myth. In India, over 300,000 farmers are reported to have committed suicide in the past two decades because of economic losses from non-performance of GM crops. Burkina Faso, for example, had to phase out the cultivation of genetically modified cotton owing to the disastrous yields it gave”.</span></p><p><span>Bassey further explained that a bulk of the food produced in the world today is by small scale farmers who use simple organic methods. Productivity can be improved with provision of needed storage and processing infrastructure, good roads to access markets and extension services. The challenge of pest outbreaks can be tackled using traditional measures without risking every other thing.</span></p><p><span>According to Joyce Ebebeinwe, project officer at HOMEF, Agricultural Biotechnology poses peculiar risks as the nation is not prepared to handle the health, environmental and economic implications of GMOs.</span></p><p><span>HOMEF advices the government of Nigeria to invest in more (independent and long-term) research on GMOs and to, in the meantime, develop safe, economically inclusive and environmentally sustainable approaches such as agroecology for improved agricultural productivity. </span></p><p><span>Biotechnology is not the way, HOMEF insists.</span></p><p> </p><p> </p>','','press_release',1527259558,1527259620),(224,'Bad Plastic Idea','<p><span>The themes for this year’s World Environment Day and World Ocean Day are centered on beating plastic pollution and thus serve as a wakeup call for all of us to take prompt actions to protect our environment and by extension our lives.</span></p><p><span>Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF) and the Fishnet Alliance in a statement made available to the press on Monday, 4th May stressed on the need for individual and collective efforts to end plastic pollution. </span></p><p><span>According to the organizations, the environment is endowed with elements of life, support and sustenance. The </span><span>Oceans which cover about 71% of the Earth&#39;s surface, and contain 97% of the planet&#39;s water</span><span> carry in them plethora of essential ingredients that supports our weather, plants, seafood and humans. </span></p><p><span>HOMEF Director, Nnimmo Bassey,stated thatplastics out of sight do not mean plastics out of lifeas many think when they trash plastic materials. “Tons of these materials end up in the gutters, rivers and the oceans. 15 tons of plastics are said to end up in the ocean every minute with more than 8 million tons being dumped in every year. </span><span>An incredible 1 million seabirds and 100,000 marine mammals lose their lives to plastic pollution yearly”.</span> </p><p><span>“If this menace continues then</span><span> <span>we will definitely have more plastics than fish in our oceans and water bodies in years to come. Already, </span></span><span>plastics have been found in more than 60% of all seabirds and in all sea turtles species that mistake plastic for food”.</span></p><p><span>“We must learn to reject plastics and not just aim to reduce, refuse, reuse or recycle them. It is time to tackle this threat at source. It is time to terminate this plastic civilization”, Mr Bassey added.</span></p><p><span>Stephen Oduware, project officer at HOMEF added that in the midst of a multitude of pollutants offshore, oil and plastics are the most insidious and injurious. There is need to <strong>clean up our oceans</strong> to help sustain the lives of the aquatic creatures and other life forms that depend on these water bodies for survival.</span></p><p><span>We have a collective duty to protect this awesome wonder of life from being turned into a dumping ground for plastics. </span><span>Plastics cannot be digested by these fishes. Other sea creatures are not left untouched; sea turtles, seal and sea lions, sea birds, dolphins, whales, and all other life forms that depend on the ocean and its biodiversity for survival are all affected negatively. More so, plastics are not easily degradable. They float around in the oceans and other water bodies for hundreds of years. It is expedient that we take all necessary actions to beat this pollution and at all cost.</span></p><p><span>HOMEF and the FishNet Alliance</span><span> called on governments, diplomats, and everyone at all levels, to </span><span>beat plastic pollution. This is a challenge that we must all brace-up to else our fishes will be replaced by plastics and humans will be left in want. </span></p><p><span>The groups also called for concerted efforts to phase out the exploration of fossil fuels from which majority of plastic materials are produced.</span></p><p><span>They recommended that; </span><span>plastic bags and polystyrene foams should be banned, paper made bags should be used in eateries and superstores rather than plastic bags and a lot more should be done to sensitize the public on the negative impacts of plastic pollution. The time to beat plastic pollution is now.</span></p><p><strong><span>About FishNet Alliance</span></strong></p><p><span>FishNet Alliance is a network of fishers engaging in, and promoting sustainable fishing </span><span>in line with bearable limits of the ecosystem</span><span>.
